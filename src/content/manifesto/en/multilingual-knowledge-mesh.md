title: Multilingual Knowledge Mesh
description: A knowledge network that spans languages and distributes globally
---

A multilingual knowledge mesh is a knowledge network where content in any
language can connect to content in any other language through shared concepts
rather than word matching. It is one expression of
[Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s vision of going
[across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums), and a step toward a
[Multilingual Memex](./multilingual-memex).

This goes beyond simple translation. In a true multilingual mesh, a note written
in Korean about a concept links to an English note about the same concept via
the underlying idea, not via keyword overlap. The
[language-agnostic index](./language-agnostic-indexing) serves as the conceptual
backbone, enabling retrieval and connection regardless of which
[Sprachraum](./sprachraum) the content originated in.

[Extracranial](./extracranial) implements early forms of this through automatic
language detection, content negotiation, and hreflang tags for locale-specific
delivery. The vision is that the system should automatically distribute content
across languages while penalizing outdated content regardless of its original
language.

For [Coscientist](./coscientist), the multilingual mesh is essential. Global
science spans many languages; a research collaborator that can only read English
is fundamentally limited. The [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) can store
[claims](./claim) from any language, with [provenance](./provenance) tracking
which source language produced which insight.
