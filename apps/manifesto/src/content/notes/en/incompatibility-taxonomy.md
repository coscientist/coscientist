title: Incompatibility Taxonomy
description: Categories of disagreement between sources
---

The incompatibility taxonomy is a classification of why sources disagree. Categories include definition differences (same word, different concepts), sampling differences (different populations or conditions), method differences (different procedures), scope drift (claims that apply to different contexts), and [nonstationarity](./nonstationarity) (the world changed between studies).

Distinguishing these matters because resolution strategies differ. A definition difference is resolved by disambiguation; a method difference may require re-running experiments; a scope difference dissolves when conditions are made explicit. Treating all disagreement as "they just disagree" loses this structure.

[Knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) in [Coscientist](./coscientist) uses this taxonomy to decompose conflicts into their causes, producing [branched resolution maps](./branched-resolution-map) rather than forced averages.
