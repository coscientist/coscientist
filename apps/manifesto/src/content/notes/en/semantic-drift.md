title: Semantic Drift
description: Changes in meaning that cause knowledge to become obsolete or misleading
---

Semantic drift is the category of [drift phenomena](./drift-phenomena) where the
meaning of terms shifts over time or across communities, causing claims to
become obsolete, misleading, or falsely contradictory.

## Forms

- [Definition Drift](./definition-drift) — when a term's meaning shifts across
  time or contexts
- [Meaning Loss](./meaning-loss) — when a claim becomes obsolete because its
  terms have changed

## Why It Matters

Semantic drift creates false contradictions: two sources may appear to disagree
when they are actually using the same word for different concepts. It also
creates false agreement: sources may appear to concur when they mean different
things by the same term.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), semantic drift is tracked by
separating [definitions](./definition-drift) from [claims](./claim). When a term
changes meaning, old claims can be marked as obsolete with pointers to the
definition changes, preserving historical context without polluting current
knowledge.
