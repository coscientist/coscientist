title: Graph as Meltdown Defense
description: How the dialectical graph structure prevents knowledge collapse
---

Graph as meltdown defense explains how the
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) specifically prevents
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown). The graph's structure—typed
relations, explicit [provenance](./provenance), and separated layers—addresses
each of the feedback loops that drive collapse.

First, the generation–citation loop is broken by
[triple separation](./triple-separation): [evidence spans](./evidence-span) are
preserved verbatim, so the system can detect when a "citation" is actually
AI-generated. Second, the linkage–authority loop is broken by
[relation typing](./relation-typing-vs-similarity): a link that says
"[attacks](./attack)" is not a trust badge; it is a challenge. Third, the
responsibility–no-agent loop is broken by explicit [provenance](./provenance):
every [claim](./claim) tracks who asserted it and on what grounds.

Without these structural features, a knowledge system is vulnerable even if it
is carefully curated at launch. The graph is the defense architecture, not just
the storage format.
