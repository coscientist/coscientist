  The civilization whose fall motivates the Encyclopedia Galactica in Asimov's
  Foundation

The Galactic Empire is the civilization in [Isaac Asimov](./isaac-asimov)'s
Foundation series whose inevitable collapse motivates
[Hari Seldon](./hari-seldon)'s interventions. At its height, the Empire spans
the galaxy; its fall will bring a
[dark night of the soul](./dark-night-of-the-soul) lasting thirty thousand years
unless shortened by deliberate action.

[Psychohistory](./psychohistory) predicts the fall with statistical certainty.
The Empire's institutions have grown brittle, its knowledge systems are
decaying, and no reform can reverse the trajectory. Seldon's response is not to
prevent collapse but to shape what comes after: the
[Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) project and the
[Seldon Plan](./seldon-plan).

For [Coscientist](./coscientist), the Galactic Empire is a metaphor for any
knowledge system that looks stable but harbors structural vulnerabilities.
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) is the knowledge-system
analogue of imperial collapse: verification fails, errors compound, and what
looked authoritative becomes unreliable. The lesson is that apparent stability
is not enough; systems need active defenses against drift and contamination.
