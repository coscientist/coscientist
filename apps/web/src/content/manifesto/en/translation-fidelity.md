title: Translation Fidelity
description: Preserving meaning and accuracy across language boundaries
---

Translation fidelity is the degree to which translated content preserves the
meaning, nuance, and accuracy of the original. High fidelity means not just
correct words but correct concepts, context, and implications. Low fidelity
means the translation technically renders the text but loses or distorts what it
actually meant.

For [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s vision of
[across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums), translation fidelity is a
first-class concern. Machine translation makes multilingual content possible at
scale, but blind trust in automated output leads to
[translation nuance loss](./translation-nuance-loss).
[Project PIRI](./project-piri) attempted to address this for developer
documentation through careful handling of technical terms and community
refinement—but was cancelled when AI coding agents made direct assistance in any
language more effective than translating English docs.

The lesson from [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) applies
directly: if users assume automated translation is always authoritative, they
may accept distorted messages without question. Just as the
[fluency trap](./fluency-trap) makes smooth AI prose seem accurate, a fluent
translation can mask subtle errors that compound over time.

[Coscientist](./coscientist) addresses this by treating translated claims as
requiring the same [verification](./verification) as any other input.
[Traceability](./traceability) must include the source language and the
translation method, so errors can be traced back and corrected when discovered.
