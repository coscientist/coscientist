title: Friction as Enemy
description: Design principle that friction kills personal knowledge workflows
---

Friction as enemy is the design principle that unnecessary effort in capturing,
organizing, or retrieving knowledge kills personal knowledge workflows. If
adding a note requires categorization, if finding an old idea requires
remembering where you put it, people stop using the system.

This principle motivates the [digital jungle](./digital-jungle) model: throw in
raw knowledge and let the system organize, link, and resurface it. The best way
to manage a garden is not constant tending but building systems that
self-maintain.

Friction is not laziness avoidance; it is a recognition that cognitive overhead
competes with thinking. Time spent on taxonomy is time not spent on insight.
[Coscientist](./coscientist) inherits this principle from
[Extracranial](./extracranial) and the ideas in
[Creating Next-gen Digital Brains](./creating-next-gen-digital-brains).
