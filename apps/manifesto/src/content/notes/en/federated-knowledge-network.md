A federated knowledge network is a system of interconnected
[Coscientist](./coscientist) instances at personal, organizational, and public
scales that exchange validated knowledge while preserving local sovereignty.
Each node maintains its own [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) and
[epistemic protocol layer](./epistemic-protocol-layer); federation provides a
channel for sharing without surrendering control.

Federation addresses the tension between collaboration and autonomy. A research
team can maintain private hypotheses while importing verified public claims. A
public knowledge commons can aggregate contributions without any single
authority dictating truth.

The key constraint is [zero-trust ingestion](./zero-trust-ingestion): imported
claims must carry [provenance](./provenance) and pass local
[verification](./verification). Sovereignty remains with the
[Operator](./operator) of each node; the network amplifies reach without
centralizing authority.

Federation also enables a
[multilingual knowledge mesh](./multilingual-knowledge-mesh): nodes operating in
different [Sprachraums](./sprachraum) can exchange validated knowledge
[across language boundaries](./across-the-sprachraums), with
[translation fidelity](./translation-fidelity) tracked as part of provenance.
This makes [cross-linguistic synthesis](./cross-linguistic-synthesis) a
network-level capability, not just a local one.
