title: Multilingual Knowledge Mesh
description: A knowledge network that spans languages and distributes globally
---

A multilingual knowledge mesh is a knowledge network where content in any language can connect to content in any other language through shared concepts rather than word matching. The mesh is the realization of [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s vision: "you just throw in random knowledge; it creates a knowledge mesh... the algorithm organizes and distributes it all around the world in different languages."

This goes beyond simple translation. In a true multilingual mesh, a note written in Korean about a concept links to an English note about the same concept via the underlying idea, not via keyword overlap. The [language-agnostic index](./language-agnostic-indexing) serves as the conceptual backbone, enabling retrieval and connection regardless of which [Sprachraum](./sprachraum) the content originated in.

[Extracranial](./extracranial) implements early forms of this through automatic language detection, content negotiation, and hreflang tags for locale-specific delivery. The vision is that the system should automatically "organize and distribute all around the world in different languages," penalizing outdated content regardless of its original language.

For [Coscientist](./coscientist), the multilingual mesh is essential. Global science spans many languages; a research collaborator that can only read English is fundamentally limited. The [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) can store [claims](./claim) from any language, with [provenance](./provenance) tracking which source language produced which insight.
