description: Evidence-based techniques for durable learning and memory
---

Learning science principles are evidence-based techniques for acquiring
knowledge that persists, transfers, and remains accessible under pressure. These
principles inform how [Coscientist](./coscientist) supports the
[Operator](./operator)'s cognitive work.

## Core Techniques

- [Active Recall](./active-recall) — studying by retrieving from memory
- [Retrieval Practice](./retrieval-practice) — strengthening memory through
  retrieval
- [Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) — scheduling review at expanding
  intervals
- [Spacing Effect](./spacing-effect) — memory improves with distributed practice
- [Interleaving](./interleaving) — mixing topics to improve discrimination
- [Meta-Learning](./meta-learning) — learning about your own learning

## Phenomena

- [Forgetting Curve](./forgetting-curve) — predictable memory decline without
  review
- [Illusions of Competence](./illusions-of-competence) — false mastery from
  passive familiarity

## Bridges to Coscientist

- [Verification as Retrieval Practice](./verification-as-retrieval-practice)
- [Dialectical Interleaving](./dialectical-interleaving)
- [Desirable Difficulty in Verification](./desirable-difficulty-in-verification)
