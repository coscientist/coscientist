# Coscientist

Coscientist is an open-source service that implements the [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) concept from Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. It aims to be more than an ark of information; it aims to be an intellectual companion that expands knowledge and contemplation together with the [Galarch](./galarch). Above all, Coscientist is a system for **Un-Brain-Rotting** our minds in the post-AI era.

## Builder

Coscientist is built by [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho).

## Origin

The system draws inspiration from the [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica)—a fictional [knowledge ark](./knowledge-ark) from Asimov's Foundation designed to preserve knowledge across [dark ages](./dark-night-of-the-soul). But Coscientist goes beyond preservation to enable discovery.

## First Principle

**Sovereignty over knowledge must remain with the [Galarch](./galarch).**

Guarding against [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) is a philosophical defensive line and the first principle of system design.

## Beyond RAG

Traditional editors use AI at the level of Q&A. Coscientist is not only about capturing knowledge about a target object; it is a system for discovering new connections and producing meaningful inference.

Based on documents and records, it tirelessly searches for new approaches, discovering methods that span agreements, grounds, and contradictions across documents. See [RAG Limitations](./rag-limitations) for why this requires a different architecture.

## Core Architecture

The system is built on a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) that stores [argumentative acts](./argumentative-act) rather than document content. Key components:

- [Dialectical Graph Nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes) - Claim, scope, assumption, definition, method, data, evidence span, source, counterexample, issue
- [Dialectical Graph Edges](./dialectical-graph-edges) - supports, attacks, undercuts, refines, generalizes, specializes, depends_on, defines, measures, cites, replicates, contradicts
- [Exploration Strategies](./exploration-strategies) - Counterexample-first search, contradiction [minimum-cut](./minimum-cut), [definition drift](./definition-drift) detection

## Operating Protocols

- [Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol) - The 1+4 human-AI collaboration system
- [Knowledge Synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) - Making documents collide rather than summarize

## The Vision

In the successful state, Coscientist can be operated not as a collection of documents, but as an **ecosystem of arguments**—a perpetual-motion encyclopedia where the [Galarch](./galarch) supervises structure while AI handles contemplation labor.
