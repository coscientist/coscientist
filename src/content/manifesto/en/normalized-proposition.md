title: Normalized Proposition
description: A standardized claim extracted from natural language text
---

A normalized proposition is a [claim](./claim) that has been extracted from
natural language and rewritten in a standardized form with explicit
[scope](./scope), [assumptions](./assumption), and dependencies. Normalization
removes ambiguity so that claims can be compared, linked, and challenged
consistently.

The same idea can be expressed in many ways. Normalization maps surface
variations to a canonical form so that two papers saying the same thing in
different words can be recognized as supporting each other.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), normalized propositions are the
[claim](./claim) nodes that participate in
[knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis). They are distinct from
[evidence spans](./evidence-span), which preserve the original wording, and from
prose in the [narrative layer](./narrative-layer), which is generated for human
reading.
