Superbrain is [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s term for the vision of a
[cognitive exoskeleton](./cognitive-exoskeleton) that amplifies human
intelligence beyond biological limits. [Extracranial](./extracranial) is
described as an "Exosuit for Superbrains": an externalized memory extension
meant to hold every idea the user has.

The superbrain is not a replacement for human cognition but an amplifier. It
should:

- store what cannot be held in memory
- retrieve what would otherwise be lost
- search and compare at scales impossible for unaided thought
- operate across languages through a
  [multilingual knowledge mesh](./multilingual-knowledge-mesh)

The human remains sovereign; the system handles the mechanical labor.

The multilingual dimension is crucial. A superbrain constrained to one
[Sprachraum](./sprachraum) is fundamentally limited. True cognitive
amplification means thinking [across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums),
accessing knowledge regardless of which language it was originally recorded in,
and synthesizing insights through
[cross-linguistic synthesis](./cross-linguistic-synthesis).

[Coscientist](./coscientist) is the research-oriented instantiation of this
vision: a multi-agent [LLM](./llm) system that reads literature in any language
and debates hypotheses through structured proposal-and-critique loops. The
superbrain dream is not distant science fiction; it is the design target.
