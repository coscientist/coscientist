title: Retrieval Practice
description: Strengthening memory by actively recalling information
---

Retrieval practice is strengthening memory by actively recalling information
rather than passively reviewing it. Each successful retrieval makes the memory
easier to access later, and each failed retrieval gives you a precise target for
restudy.

In practice, it looks like practice tests, flashcards, or explaining a concept
from a blank page. [Active Recall](./active-recall) is the day-to-day behavior;
[Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) is a common way to schedule it.
[Interleaving](./interleaving) adds another dimension: mixing problem types
within a session to improve discrimination.
