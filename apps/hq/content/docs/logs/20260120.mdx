## UI Translation Sync

**Scope**: `apps/web`

### Changes Made

| File | Change |
| ---- | ------ |
| `apps/web/messages/*.json` | Updated all locale strings to match `ko.json` as the source of truth, including landing copy and UI labels. |

### Technical Decisions

1. **Korean as source**: Treated `ko.json` as the canonical copy and translated all other locales from it to keep messaging consistent.

### Verification

- TypeScript: Not run (not requested)
- Build: Not run (not requested)
- Tests: Not run (not requested)

### Next Steps

None.

## Marketing Copy & Title Case Pass

**Scope**: `apps/web`

### Changes Made

| File | Change |
| ---- | ------ |
| `apps/web/messages/*.json` | Refined marketing tone, title-cased headings/labels, re-centered hero/CTA line breaks, and updated CTA phrasing across locales. |

### Technical Decisions

1. **Title-case hierarchy**: Applied title case to headings and UI labels to match the requested marketing presentation.
2. **Centered line breaks**: Rebalanced hero and CTA line breaks to read as two centered lines in each locale.

### Verification

- TypeScript: Not run (not requested)
- Build: Not run (not requested)
- Tests: Not run (not requested)

### Next Steps

None.
