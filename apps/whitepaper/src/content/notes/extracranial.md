description: Sunghyun Cho's personal digital brain and publishing system
---

Extracranial is [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s personal digital brain: a static-site publishing system with automated links (including backlinks) and controlled decay, so old notes fade unless explicitly kept evergreen.

It grew out of [Project Aldehyde](./project-aldehyde) and the ideas in [Creating Next-gen Digital Brains](./creating-next-gen-digital-brains). A reference overview is at https://cho.sh/r/000000.
