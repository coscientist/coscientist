title: Spacing Effect
description: Memory improves when study sessions are spaced over time
---

The spacing effect is the well-replicated finding that learning is stronger when study sessions are separated by time instead of massed together. Spacing forces retrieval after partial forgetting, which strengthens the memory trace and improves long-term retention.

[Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) is essentially an algorithmic way to exploit this: it times reviews so that recall remains effortful but possible.
