title: Coscientist
description: An intellectual companion system for knowledge production in the post-AI era
---

Coscientist is an open-source service inspired by [Isaac Asimov](./isaac-asimov)'s fictional [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica). It is meant to be more than a [knowledge ark](./knowledge-ark) of information: an intellectual companion that expands contemplation together with the human [Operator](./operator). Above all, it is a system for un-brain-rotting our minds in the post-AI era.

It is built by [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho). The origin story is straightforward: preservation matters, but preservation alone does not produce understanding. Coscientist is designed to make knowledge updateable so that contradictions, counterexamples, and definition drift become visible and actionable instead of being smoothed away by fluent summaries.

The first principle is sovereignty: knowledge authority must remain with the [Operator](./operator). Guarding against [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) is not an afterthought; it is a design constraint. AI can do contemplation labor, but it should not seize the initiative of writing and declaring.

This is why Coscientist goes beyond Q&A-style RAG (see [RAG limitations](./rag-limitations)). It maintains a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) that stores [argumentative acts](./argumentative-act) rather than raw document text, so every claim can be bound to evidence spans, sources, and explicit relations such as attacks, undercuts, and citations (see [Dialectical Graph Nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes) and [Dialectical Graph Edges](./dialectical-graph-edges)). Exploration is driven by strategies that prioritize adversarial pressure, including counterexample-first search, contradiction isolation via [minimum cut](./minimum-cut), and explicit [definition drift](./definition-drift) detection (see [Exploration Strategies](./exploration-strategies)).

At the protocol level, the system uses procedures like the [Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol) and [knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) to make documents collide rather than merely summarize. Because it uses [LLMs](./llm), Coscientist can perform [cross-linguistic synthesis](./cross-linguistic-synthesis): reading and synthesizing literature in any language, enabling a truly [multilingual knowledge mesh](./multilingual-knowledge-mesh). The intended successful state is an ecosystem of arguments: AI handles the search and restructuring work, while the Operator supervises structure and verification so the resulting narrative remains traceable.
