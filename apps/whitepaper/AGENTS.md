# Whitepaper - AI Agent Guidelines

> **IMPORTANT**: This file should be updated regularly as the project evolves. After making significant changes, update this document to reflect new patterns, decisions, and learnings.

## Project Philosophy

### Core Concept

Andy Matuschak-style sliding panes for documentation. Users click links to open notes in new panes stacking horizontally, creating a "rabbit hole" exploration trail while maintaining context.

### Key UX Principles

1. **Context preservation** - Never lose where you came from
2. **Horizontal stacking** - New panes open to the right
3. **Book spine collapse** - Overflow panes shrink to thin spines showing titles vertically
4. **Duplicate allowed** - Clicking an existing note appends it again (stack becomes [1,2,3,1] not [1])
5. **URL-synced state** - Stack state persists in `?stack=a,b,c&focus=N` format

### Key Patterns

#### Stack State Management

- Root note from URL path: `/notes/coscientist`
- Additional panes from query: `?stack=dialectical-graph,active-recall`
- Focus parameter: `?stack=a,b&focus=1` (optional, defaults to last pane)
- Full stack: `[coscientist, dialectical-graph, active-recall]`

#### CSS-Based Pane Collapse (Obsidian-style)

- Uses `position: sticky` with incrementing `left` offset per pane
- Each pane offsets by 40px: `left: ${index * 40}px`
- Panes stack/overlap as user scrolls right, showing slivers of left panes
- Z-index increases with index so later panes appear on top
- No JavaScript collapse logic - pure CSS behavior

#### Link Interception

- Internal links (relative, not http/mailto) are intercepted
- `pushNote(slug, fromPaneIndex)` appends to stack
- Panes after `fromPaneIndex` are trimmed before appending

## UI Skills (Opinionated Constraints)

### Stack

- MUST use Tailwind CSS defaults (spacing, radius, shadows) before custom values
- MUST use motion/react (formerly framer-motion) when JavaScript animation is required
- SHOULD use tw-animate-css for entrance and micro-animations in Tailwind CSS
- MUST use cn utility (clsx + tailwind-merge) for class logic

### Components

- MUST use accessible component primitives for anything with keyboard or focus behavior (Base UI, React Aria, Radix)
- MUST use the project's existing component primitives first
- NEVER mix primitive systems within the same interaction surface
- SHOULD prefer Base UI for new primitives if compatible with the stack
- MUST add an aria-label to icon-only buttons
- NEVER rebuild keyboard or focus behavior by hand unless explicitly requested

### Interaction

- MUST use an AlertDialog for destructive or irreversible actions
- SHOULD use structural skeletons for loading states
- NEVER use h-screen, h-dvh, vh, dvh, or any viewport-specific CSS units
- MUST use flex-1 with flex containers for full-height layouts
- MUST respect safe-area-inset for fixed elements
- MUST show errors next to where the action happens
- NEVER block paste in input or textarea elements

### Animation

- NEVER add animation unless it is explicitly requested
- MUST animate only compositor props (transform, opacity)
- NEVER animate layout properties (width, height, top, left, margin, padding)
- SHOULD avoid animating paint properties (background, color) except for small, local UI (text, icons)
- SHOULD use ease-out on entrance
- NEVER exceed 200ms for interaction feedback
- MUST pause looping animations when off-screen
- MUST respect prefers-reduced-motion
- NEVER introduce custom easing curves unless explicitly requested
- SHOULD avoid animating large images or full-screen surfaces

### Typography

- MUST use text-balance for headings and text-pretty for body/paragraphs
- MUST use tabular-nums for data
- SHOULD use truncate or line-clamp for dense UI
- NEVER modify letter-spacing (tracking-) unless explicitly requested

### Layout

- MUST use a fixed z-index scale (no arbitrary z-x)
- SHOULD use size-x for square elements instead of w-x + h-x

### Performance

- NEVER animate large blur() or backdrop-filter surfaces
- NEVER apply will-change outside an active animation
- NEVER use useEffect for anything that can be expressed as render logic

### Design

- NEVER use gradients unless explicitly requested
- NEVER use purple or multicolor gradients
- NEVER use glow effects as primary affordances
- SHOULD use Tailwind CSS default shadow scale unless explicitly requested
- MUST give empty states one clear next action
- SHOULD limit accent color usage to one per view
- SHOULD use existing theme or Tailwind CSS color tokens before introducing new ones

## Component Guidelines

### When Using COSS/UI

- Prefer semantic components: `Card`, `Separator`, `Spinner` over raw divs
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes
- Follow existing import patterns from `@/components/ui/`

### Tailwind Conventions

- Use design tokens: `bg-card`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`
- Responsive: mobile-first with `md:` breakpoints
- Animation: only when explicitly requested, use compositor props only

### TypeScript

- Define types in `src/lib/types.ts`
- Use strict mode, avoid `any`
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes
