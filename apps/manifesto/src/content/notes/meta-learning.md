Meta-learning is learning about your own learning: noticing what sticks, what fails, and what conditions change the outcome. It turns "study" from a habit into a feedback loop with hypotheses, experiments, and adjustments.

Practically, it means tracking which strategies (for example [active recall](./active-recall) versus re-reading), which schedules (like [spaced repetition](./spaced-repetition)), and which environments actually produce transfer, not just comfort.
