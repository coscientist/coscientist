title: Dialectical Graph Edges
description: The relation types connecting nodes in a dialectical knowledge graph
---

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), edges encode relation types
rather than similarity scores. The value is that you can ask "how does this bear
on that?" rather than only "are these about the same topic?"

Common relation types include:

- Support: `supports`
- Challenge: `attacks`, `undercuts`, `contradicts`
- Refinement and scope: `refines`, `generalizes`, `specializes`, `depends_on`
- Provenance and measurement: `cites`, `defines`, `measures`
- Replication: `replicates`, `fails_to_replicate`
- Optional topical links: `is_about`

Typed edges enable knowledge updating through rebuttal chains, detection of
definition conflicts, and tracking of replication status. These are capabilities
that similarity-based retrieval struggles to represent ). They also support
quality assessment: knowledge quality depends less on the direction of a
conclusion and more on the durability of the path that produced it, and edges
encode that path structure.
