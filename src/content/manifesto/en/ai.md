title: AI
description: Artificial Intelligence as both tool and challenge for knowledge systems
---

AI in the context of [Coscientist](./coscientist) refers to systems that perform
cognitive tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence: reading,
summarizing, generating, and reasoning about text. The primary technology is the
[LLM](./llm) .

AI is simultaneously the engine and the threat. On one hand, AI performs
[contemplation labor](./contemplation-labor): searching, structuring, and
generating candidates at speeds impossible for humans. On the other hand, AI
creates failure modes that demand new defenses:
[hallucination](./hallucination), [AI slop](./ai-slop),
[model collapse](./model-collapse), and
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown).

## AI as Tool

- [LLM](./llm) — the underlying technology
- [Contemplation Labor](./contemplation-labor) — cognitive work AI performs
- [Cross-Linguistic Synthesis](./cross-linguistic-synthesis) — reading any
  language
- [Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol) — using multiple
  models

## AI Failure Modes

- [Hallucination](./hallucination) — plausible but fabricated outputs
- [AI Slop](./ai-slop) — low-quality generated content
- [Fluency Trap](./fluency-trap) — mistaking smooth prose for accuracy
- [Model Collapse](./model-collapse) — degradation from self-training

## Human-AI Relations

- [Operator](./operator) — the human sovereign
- [Cognitive Sovereignty](./cognitive-sovereignty) — keeping humans in control
- [Deskilling Through AI Delegation](./deskilling-through-ai-delegation) — risk
  of atrophied skills
- [AI-Induced Illusions of Competence](./ai-induced-illusions-of-competence) —
  false mastery
