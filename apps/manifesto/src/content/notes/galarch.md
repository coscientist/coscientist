title: Galarch
description: The human sovereign over knowledge in Coscientist
---

The Galarch is the human operator who maintains sovereignty over knowledge in [Coscientist](./coscientist). The name evokes a guardian-architect of an [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica): someone responsible for structure, provenance, and correction, not just output.

Preventing [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) requires the Galarch to keep initiative over contemplation while using AI as a tool. That means maintaining [cognitive sovereignty](./cognitive-sovereignty), coordinating multi-model deliberation when stakes are high (see the [Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol)), exercising veto power, and investing scarce human time in the [minimum contradiction set](./minimum-contradiction-set) rather than in sentence labor.

This role is as much cultural as technical. Like a driver with safety systems, the Galarch still has to habituate the discipline of verification, because the system cannot compensate for a user who treats fluency as truth.
