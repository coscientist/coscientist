title: Graph-Based Spaced Repetition
description: "Using claim age or rebuttal-age to trigger re-verification"
---

Graph-based spaced repetition applies [spaced repetition](./spaced-repetition)
principles to knowledge maintenance: [claims](./claim) that have not been
verified recently, or whose supporting evidence has not been challenged in a
while, are surfaced for re-examination.

The insight is that knowledge, like memory, decays without active engagement. A
claim verified three years ago may no longer hold if the world has changed, if
definitions have shifted, or if new [counterexamples](./counterexample) have
emerged.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), this can be implemented by
tracking the last verification timestamp for each claim and its supporting
paths. The [Operator](./operator) is prompted to re-verify claims on a schedule,
with intervals expanding for robust claims and contracting for contested ones.
