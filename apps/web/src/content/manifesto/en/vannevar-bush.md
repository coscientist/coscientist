description: Engineer and science administrator who envisioned the Memex
---

Vannevar Bush (1890–1974) was an American engineer, inventor, and science
administrator who directed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and
Development during World War II. He is best known in knowledge systems history
for his 1945 essay [As We May Think](./as-we-may-think), which proposed the
[Memex](./memex).

The Memex was never built, but the vision—a personal device for storing,
linking, and navigating information through associative trails—shaped decades of
subsequent work in hypertext, personal computing, and knowledge management.
Bush's insight was that knowledge work is fundamentally non-linear and that
tools should let people build trails between sources rather than forcing
everything into a single outline.

For [Coscientist](./coscientist), Bush represents the origin point of a lineage:
from Memex to [digital brain](./digital-brain) to
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph). The evolution is
[from Memex to Dialectical Graph](./from-memex-to-dialectical-graph): Bush's
associative trails become typed argumentative relations.
