description: A verifiable proposition stored as a node in a dialectical graph
---

A claim is a verifiable proposition extracted from text and stored as a
first-class [Dialectical Graph node](./dialectical-graph-nodes) in a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph). (See [Dialectical Graph Nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes).) Claims are not
raw sentences; they are normalized statements with explicit [scope](./scope),
[assumptions](./assumption), and [method](./method) dependencies.

Claims can be linked to [evidence spans](./evidence-span) that support them,
[counterexamples](./counterexample) that narrow them, [attacks](./attack) that
challenge them, and [undercuts](./undercut) that question their grounds. This
relational structure enables knowledge to update through rebuttal rather than
replacement.

Every claim has a status ): it may be tentative, contested, conditionally
supported, robust, refuted, or obsolete. The status changes based on the type of
rebuttal, not the number, and it can regress if the supporting structure
weakens.
