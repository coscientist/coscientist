description: An early attempt to build a personal digital brain
---

Project Aldehyde was [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s early attempt to build a
personal [digital brain](./digital-brain): a system that could accumulate
writing, sources, and context without constant manual organization.

It led to [Extracranial](./extracranial) and influenced later ideas behind
[Coscientist](./coscientist), especially around lowering friction while keeping
provenance intact.
