title: Memex
description: Vannevar Bush's proposed personal knowledge machine
---

The Memex is [Vannevar Bush](./vannevar-bush)'s proposed electromechanical
personal archive for storing and associatively linking records. The important
idea is less the hardware and more the interaction pattern: knowledge becomes
navigable when you can build trails between sources and return to them later
along the same path of thought.

Bush introduced the Memex in his essay [As We May Think](./as-we-may-think),
which later influenced many concepts that look like a modern
[digital brain](./digital-brain). The [multilingual Memex](./multilingual-memex)
extends this vision to knowledge systems that natively support content in
multiple languages, with automatic translation and
[cross-linguistic synthesis](./cross-linguistic-synthesis).
