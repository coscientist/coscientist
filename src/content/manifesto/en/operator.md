title: Operator
description: "The human sovereign over knowledge in Coscientist"
---

The Operator is the human sovereign over knowledge in
[Coscientist](./coscientist). The name evokes a guardian-architect of an
[Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica): someone responsible for
structure, provenance, and correction, not just output.

Preventing [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) requires the
Operator to keep initiative over contemplation while using AI as a tool. That
means maintaining [cognitive sovereignty](./cognitive-sovereignty), coordinating
multi-model deliberation when stakes are high, exercising veto power, and
investing scarce human time in the
[minimum contradiction set](./minimum-contradiction-set) rather than in sentence
labor.

This role is as much cultural as technical. Like a driver with safety systems,
the Operator still has to build the habit of verification, because the system
cannot compensate for a user who treats fluency as truth.
