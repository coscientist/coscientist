title: Monolith as Interface Metaphor
description: How the Monolith informs sliding pane navigation
---

The [Monolith](./monolith) from _2001: A Space Odyssey_ provides more than visual
inspiration—it offers a model for knowledge interaction. The sliding pane
interface translates this into functional design.

## Proportions and Space

The Monolith's 1:4:9 ratio appears throughout the interface:

- Pane width ratios when stacked
- Vertical rhythm in typography
- Spacing between elements

These proportions create visual harmony without explicit ornamentation.

## Horizontal Stacking

When multiple notes open, they stack horizontally like Monoliths in a row. Each
pane is a self-contained slab of knowledge. The leftmost pane shows where you
started; the rightmost shows where you are now.

This preserves context: you can trace your path backward through the stack,
understanding how you arrived at the current note.

## Collapse to Spine

When space runs out, panes collapse to thin vertical spines—book spines on a
shelf. The title rotates 90 degrees, readable but minimal. Click to expand.

This mirrors the Monolith's behavior: present when needed, receding when not.

## Depth Through Opacity

The [Monolith](./monolith) logo uses three bars at 100%, 50%, and 20% opacity.
This suggests depth—Monoliths receding into distance. The interface uses similar
opacity gradations to indicate focus and relevance.
