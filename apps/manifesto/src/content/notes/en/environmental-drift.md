title: Environmental Drift
description: Changes in the world that invalidate previously valid knowledge
---

Environmental drift is the category of [drift phenomena](./drift-phenomena)
where the external world changes, causing previously valid knowledge to become
outdated or inapplicable.

## Primary Form

- [Nonstationarity](./nonstationarity) — when the data-generating process
  changes over time

## Why It Matters

Environmental drift means that knowledge has a temporal scope. A claim that was
true in 2010 may not be true in 2025—not because it was wrong, but because the
world changed. Markets shift, technologies evolve, populations change, and what
was once a reliable pattern may no longer hold.

This is distinct from [semantic drift](./semantic-drift): the words mean the
same thing, but the world they describe is different. It requires tracking when
and where claims were validated, so that outdated knowledge can be flagged
rather than silently applied to new contexts.
