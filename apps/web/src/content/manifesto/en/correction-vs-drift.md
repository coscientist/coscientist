  Economic principle that a knowledge system survives only if correction cost

Correction vs drift is the economic principle that a knowledge system remains
healthy only if the cost of correcting errors stays below the cost of letting
them propagate. When correction becomes expensive , drift wins: errors persist
because fixing them is not worth the effort.

The [epistemic protocol layer](./epistemic-protocol-layer) is designed to keep
correction cheap. [Traceability](./traceability) means you can find what needs
fixing; explicit [claims](./claim) mean you can target changes precisely; and
the [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) means updates propagate through
relations rather than requiring manual rewrites.

[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) is what happens when drift wins
permanently: the system stabilizes around an "approximately maintained" false
steady state because no one can afford to clean it up.
