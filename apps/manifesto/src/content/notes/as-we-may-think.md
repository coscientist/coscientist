description: Vannevar Bush's 1945 essay outlining the Memex
---

"As We May Think" is Vannevar Bush's 1945 essay proposing the [Memex](./memex) and the idea of associative trails through knowledge. The lasting contribution is not the specific machinery; it is the claim that knowledge work is fundamentally non-linear, and tools should let people link sources as they think rather than forcing everything into a single outline.
