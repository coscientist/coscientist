title: Spaced Repetition
description: A learning technique based on increasing intervals of review
---

Spaced repetition is an evidence-based way to schedule review so you practice
recall right before you would forget. It leverages the
[spacing effect](./spacing-effect) and the shape of the
[forgetting curve](./forgetting-curve): intervals expand when you remember and
contract when you do not.

In practice, you learn something, test yourself soon, then revisit it after
longer and longer gaps as long as retrieval stays successful. Tools like Anki
and SuperMemo automate the interval adjustments, but the core is still
retrieval, not repetition.

It is especially effective for large bodies of discrete knowledge and easy to
misuse as passive card-flipping. The cards should force genuine recall, not
recognition. Combining spaced repetition with [interleaving](./interleaving) and
[meta-learning](./meta-learning) yields a more complete picture of effective
study.
