title: Issue Node
description: "A bundle of colliding claim clusters in a dialectical graph"
---

An issue node is a graph object that bundles colliding [claims](./claim) into a
coherent object of inquiry. It names the question, records which claims
conflict, and tracks the conditions under which the conflict might resolve.

Issue nodes turn contention into structure. Instead of scattering attacks and
counterexamples across the graph, the system groups them: "These four claims
cannot all be true under these conditions; here are the resolution paths." This
is why [knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) produces issue clusters
rather than averaged summaries.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), issue nodes are first-class
objects that connect to [contention](./contention) and to the claims involved.
Resolving an issue means either refuting some claims, narrowing their
[scope](./scope), or disambiguating [definitions](./definition-drift).
