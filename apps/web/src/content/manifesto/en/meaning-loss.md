title: Meaning Loss
description: When a claim becomes obsolete because its terms have shifted meaning
---

Meaning loss occurs when a [claim](./claim) becomes obsolete not because it was
refuted but because the terms it uses have shifted meaning through
[definition drift](./definition-drift). The claim may still be "true" under its
original definitions, but those definitions are no longer in use, so the claim
no longer communicates anything actionable.

This is a distinct failure mode from refutation. A refuted claim was shown to be
false; a meaning-lost claim was never tested against current concepts. Treating
meaning-lost claims as live knowledge creates confusion because readers
interpret them through current definitions.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), meaning loss is tracked through
the [claim status taxonomy](./claim-status-taxonomy). Claims can be marked
obsolete with pointers to the definition changes that severed their relevance,
preserving historical context without polluting current knowledge.
