title: Undercut
description: An attack on the method, assumption, or definition underlying a claim
---

An undercut is a challenge that targets not the [claim](./claim) itself but the
grounds on which it rests: the [method](./method), [assumption](./assumption),
or definition that makes the claim meaningful. If the undercut succeeds, the
claim loses support even if no direct [counterexample](./counterexample) is
found.

The distinction matters for resolution. A direct [attack](./attack) can be
answered with more evidence; an undercut requires re-examining the foundations.
In debates, undercuts often go unaddressed because they feel like "changing the
subject," but they can be decisive.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), undercuts are a specific edge
type recorded in the [Dialectical Graph Edges](./dialectical-graph-edges).
Tracking them separately allows the system to distinguish "we disagree on the
facts" from "we disagree on how facts should be gathered."
