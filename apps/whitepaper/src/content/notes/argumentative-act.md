title: Argumentative Act
description: A move in reasoning such as asserting, defining, or rebutting
---

An argumentative act is a distinct move in reasoning—asserting a claim, defining a term, providing evidence, rebutting, or undercutting an assumption. The point of naming the act is that the same sentence can play different roles depending on context: claim, evidence, definition, or critique.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), the system stores these acts (as nodes and edges) rather than only storing raw text, so later synthesis can track what was said, on what grounds, and how it was challenged. See [Dialectical Graph Nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes) and [Dialectical Graph Edges](./dialectical-graph-edges).
