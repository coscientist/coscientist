title: Signal Without Explanation
description: Presenting information and trusting the reader to understand
---

The [Monolith](./monolith) does not explain itself. It appears, it acts, it
leaves. Those who encounter it either understand or they do not. This is not
cruelty—it is respect.

## The Principle

Present information clearly. Do not over-explain. Trust the reader's
intelligence.

When documentation hedges every statement with caveats, qualifications, and
hand-holding, it communicates doubt in the reader. When it states facts plainly,
it communicates trust.

## Anti-Patterns

- "As you probably know..."
- "Simply put..."
- "In other words..."
- "To clarify..."
- "What this means is..."

These phrases assume the reader failed to understand the first time. They pad
word count while adding no information.

## Application in [Coscientist](./coscientist)

### Links as Invitations

A link does not explain what it contains. It names a concept and trusts the
reader to click if curious. The link text is the signal; the linked note is the
explanation for those who seek it.

### Frontmatter Over Inline Explanation

Metadata belongs in frontmatter. The reader who needs it can find it. The reader
who does not should not wade through it.

### Error States

When something fails, state what failed. Do not apologize, do not speculate, do
not offer life advice. The user needs information, not comfort.

## The [Minimalism](./mystery-minimalism) Connection

[Mystery and Minimalism](./mystery-minimalism) removes visual noise. Signal
Without Explanation removes verbal noise. Both derive from the same source: the
[Monolith](./monolith)'s silent authority.

## Trust as Design

Every explanation you remove is a vote of confidence in your reader. Every
explanation you add is a hedge against their incompetence. Choose carefully.
