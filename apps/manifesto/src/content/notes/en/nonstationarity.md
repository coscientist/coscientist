title: Nonstationarity
description: When the data-generating process changes over time
---

Nonstationarity means the underlying process that produces data changes over
time. When conditions shift, older evidence may no longer apply without
adjustment: an effect can disappear, invert, or become conditional simply
because the world is different.

This matters for synthesis because time-driven change can masquerade as
contradiction. [Knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) therefore separates
nonstationarity from true incompatibility by tracking when and where claims were
intended to apply.
