title: From Memex to Dialectical Graph
description: Evolution from associative trails to argumentative structure
---

From Memex to Dialectical Graph traces the evolution of personal knowledge
systems: from [Vannevar Bush](./vannevar-bush)'s [Memex](./memex), which stored
records and linked them by associative trails, to the
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), which stores [claims](./claim),
[evidence](./evidence-span), and
[argumentative relations](./argumentative-relations).

The key shift is from links to typed relations. A Memex trail says "these two
ideas are connected." A dialectical edge says `attacks`, `undercuts`,
`supports`, or `cites`. The difference matters for
[knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis): you can ask "what supports or
challenges this claim?" rather than only "what is nearby?"

This is why links are not enough to prevent
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown). A densely linked wiki can
still collapse if the links do not distinguish support from attack, evidence
from opinion, or primary source from restatement.
