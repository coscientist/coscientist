title: Incompatibility Taxonomy
description: Categories of disagreement between sources
---

The incompatibility taxonomy is a classification of why sources disagree.
Categories include definition differences , sampling differences , method
differences , scope drift , and [nonstationarity](./nonstationarity) .

Distinguishing these matters because resolution strategies differ. A definition
difference is resolved by disambiguation; a method difference may require
re-running experiments; a scope difference dissolves when conditions are made
explicit. Treating all disagreement as "they just disagree" loses this
structure.

[Knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) in [Coscientist](./coscientist)
uses this taxonomy to decompose conflicts into their causes, producing
[branched resolution maps](./branched-resolution-map) rather than forced
averages.
