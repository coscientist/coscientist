title: Psychohistory
description: A fictional statistical science in Asimov's Foundation
---

Psychohistory is a fictional discipline in [Isaac Asimov](./isaac-asimov)'s
Foundation series combining history, sociology, and mathematics to predict the
large-scale behavior of civilizations. The premise is that individuals are
unpredictable but statistical regularities emerge at scale, making broad
trajectories forecastable under stable assumptions.

It is the scientific basis for the [Seldon Plan](./seldon-plan) and the creation
of the [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica), developed by [Hari Seldon](./hari-seldon).
