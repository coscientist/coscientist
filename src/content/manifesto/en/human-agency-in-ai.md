title: Human Agency in AI
description:
  Principles and mechanisms for keeping humans in control of AI-assisted
  knowledge work
---

Human agency in [AI](./ai) is the cluster of principles and mechanisms that keep
the human [Operator](./operator) in control of knowledge work, even when AI
performs substantial [contemplation labor](./contemplation-labor).

## Core Principles

- [Cognitive Sovereignty](./cognitive-sovereignty) — human control over judgment
  and verification
- [Cognitive Agency Preservation](./cognitive-agency-preservation) — AI
  strengthens judgment, does not replace it
- [Operator](./operator) — the human role as sovereign verifier

## Mechanisms

- [Responsibility Line](./responsibility-line) — tracing who asserted what
- [Verification](./verification) — active checking, not passive acceptance
- [Desirable Difficulty in Verification](./desirable-difficulty-in-verification)
  — making verification effortful to maintain engagement

## Risks

- [Fluency Trap](./fluency-trap) — accepting smooth output without scrutiny
- [Deskilling Through AI Delegation](./deskilling-through-ai-delegation) —
  atrophying skills by not using them
- [AI-Induced Illusions of Competence](./ai-induced-illusions-of-competence) —
  false mastery from AI assistance
