title: Institutional Brain Rot
description: Organizational failure mode where collective verification capacity degrades
---

Institutional brain rot is a failure mode in which an organization's collective
capacity to verify and update knowledge degrades over time. It is distinct from
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown), which is a system-level
collapse driven by AI contamination; brain rot is a human-organizational
phenomenon.

Symptoms include reliance on outdated internal documents, inability to
distinguish rumor from fact, fear of correcting senior authority, and the
gradual substitution of fluency for rigor. The organization "knows" things that
are no longer true, and the cost of correction exceeds the perceived cost of
drift.

[Coscientist](./coscientist) addresses institutional brain rot through
cross-referencing, adversarial review via
[rebuttal-first search](./rebuttal-first-search), and explicit
[traceability](./traceability) so that claims can be challenged without social
friction.
