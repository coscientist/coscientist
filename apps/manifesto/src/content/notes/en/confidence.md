title: Confidence
description: A multi-dimensional measure of support for a claim
---

Confidence in [Coscientist](./coscientist) is not a single probability score. It
is a multi-dimensional status that reflects how a [claim](./claim) has survived
scrutiny: what kinds of evidence support it, what challenges it has withstood,
and how robust its path structure is.

The dimensions include evidence type , replication status , challenge history ,
and path diversity . A claim can be highly confident on one dimension and weak
on another.

This multi-dimensional view prevents the [fluency trap](./fluency-trap): a claim
that "feels confident" because it is stated smoothly is not the same as a claim
that has been tested and survived. See
[Dialectical Graph Nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes) for the status taxonomy.
