title: Coscientist
description: "An intellectual companion system for knowledge production in the post-AI era"
---

Coscientist is an open-source service inspired by
[Isaac Asimov](./isaac-asimov)'s fictional
[Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica). It is meant to be more than
a [knowledge ark](./knowledge-ark) of information: an
[intellectual companion](./intellectual-companion) that performs
[contemplation labor](./contemplation-labor) alongside the human
[Operator](./operator). In the post-AI era, its goal is to support
[un-brain-rotting](./un-brain-rotting): restoring verification and agency.

It is built by [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho). The origin story is
straightforward: preservation matters, but preservation alone does not produce
understanding ([Tokens ≠ Knowledge](./index)). Coscientist is designed to make knowledge updatable so
contradictions, counterexamples, and [definition drift](./definition-drift)
become visible and actionable instead of being smoothed away by fluent
summaries.

The first principle is sovereignty: knowledge authority must remain with the
[Operator](./operator). Guarding against
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) is not an afterthought; it is a
design constraint. AI can do contemplation labor, but it should not seize the
initiative of writing and declaring.

This is why Coscientist goes beyond Q&A-style RAG. It maintains a
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) that stores
[argumentative acts](./argumentative-act) rather than raw document text, so
every claim can be tied to evidence spans, sources, and explicit relations and
[Dialectical Graph Edges](./dialectical-graph-edges).

Exploration is adversarial by default. Strategies like
[counterexample-first search](./counterexample-first-search), contradiction
isolation via [minimum cut](./minimum-cut), and explicit
[definition drift](./definition-drift) detection apply pressure early so
knowledge updates by rebuttal instead of drifting by repetition.

At the protocol level, the system uses procedures like the
[Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol) and
[knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) to make documents collide rather
than merely summarize. Because it uses [LLMs](./llm), Coscientist can perform
[cross-linguistic synthesis](./cross-linguistic-synthesis): reading and
synthesizing literature in any language, enabling a truly
[multilingual knowledge mesh](./multilingual-knowledge-mesh). The intended end
state is an ecosystem of arguments: AI handles search and restructuring, while
the Operator supervises structure and verification so the resulting narrative
remains traceable.
