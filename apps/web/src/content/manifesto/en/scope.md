title: Scope
description: "The conditions of applicability for a claim"
---

Scope defines where and when a [claim](./claim) is intended to apply: the
populations, time periods, contexts, or conditions under which the claim is
asserted to hold. A claim without explicit scope is ambiguous; a claim with
overly broad scope is vulnerable to [counterexamples](./counterexample).

Many disagreements dissolve when scope is made explicit. Two studies can reach
opposite conclusions and both be correct if they apply to different populations
or conditions. This is why [knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis)
separates scope-based incompatibility from true contradiction.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), scope is a node type connected to
claims. When a counterexample is found, the system can narrow the scope rather
than discard the claim entirely.
