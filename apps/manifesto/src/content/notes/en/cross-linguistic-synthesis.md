title: Cross-Linguistic Synthesis
description: Combining knowledge from multiple languages into unified understanding
---

Cross-linguistic synthesis is the process of combining knowledge from sources in
different languages into a single, coherent understanding. It is more than
translation: it lets ideas from different [Sprachraums](./sprachraum) meet,
disagree, and update one another.

For [Coscientist](./coscientist), this is a native capability because modern
[LLMs](./llm) can read many languages. In practice, cross-linguistic synthesis
can:

- pull [sources](./source) across languages
- extract and normalize [claims](./claim)
- connect claims through shared concepts via
  [language-agnostic indexing](./language-agnostic-indexing)
- produce hypotheses and rebuttals that remain traceable to original-language
  sources

The hard part is avoiding false agreement and false disagreement. The process
must account for [translation nuance loss](./translation-nuance-loss) and
[definition drift](./definition-drift) across languages: a single term can map
to different concepts, and translation errors can create the illusion of
consensus.

This requires [traceability](./traceability) back to original expressions when
questions arise, not just fluent translated summaries.
