title: Verification
description: The process of checking claims against evidence and counterevidence
---

Verification is the process of checking whether a claim holds up against
evidence, counterevidence, and alternative explanations. It is not passive
acceptance: it requires effort, and that effort is what distinguishes knowledge
from belief.

In [Coscientist](./coscientist), verification is the responsibility of the
[Operator](./operator). AI can perform
[contemplation labor](./contemplation-labor), surfacing candidates and
rebuttals, but the human decides what counts as verified. This preserves
[cognitive sovereignty](./cognitive-sovereignty): the Operator remains the
author of their knowledge, not a passive consumer of AI output.

Techniques like [rebuttal-first search](./rebuttal-first-search) make
verification adversarial by default, seeking counterevidence before acceptance.
The [Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol) adds a social
dimension: disagreement among models is treated as a signal that more scrutiny
is warranted.

For a fuller implementation framing, see the [Verification System](./verification-system).
