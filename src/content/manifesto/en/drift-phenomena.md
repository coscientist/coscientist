title: Drift Phenomena
description: Time-driven changes in knowledge systems
---

Drift phenomena are the ways that knowledge systems change over time, often
invisibly, leading to errors that look like contradiction but are actually about
temporal mismatch.

## [Semantic Drift](./semantic-drift)

- [Definition Drift](./definition-drift) — when a term's meaning shifts across
  time or communities
- [Meaning Loss](./meaning-loss) — when claims become obsolete because their
  terms no longer apply

## [Environmental Drift](./environmental-drift)

- [Nonstationarity](./nonstationarity) — when the underlying process that
  produces data changes over time

## [System Drift](./system-drift)

- [Model Collapse](./model-collapse) — degradation from training on AI-generated
  data
- [Correction vs Drift](./correction-vs-drift) — what happens when fixing errors
  costs more than letting them propagate

## Defense

The [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) tracks drift explicitly by
separating [definitions](./definition-drift) from [claims](./claim) and
recording when and where claims were intended to apply. This prevents false
contradictions from temporal mismatch.
