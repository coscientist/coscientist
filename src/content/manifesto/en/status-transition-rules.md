title: "Status Transition Rules"
description: "What triggers movement between claim states in a dialectical graph"
---

Status transition rules define what moves a [claim](./claim) from one state to
another in the [claim status taxonomy](./claim-status-taxonomy). Transitions
depend on the type of challenge, not the count: a single decisive
[counterexample](./counterexample) matters more than many unconvincing
objections.

Key transitions include: tentative → contested is registered, contested →
conditionally supported or clarifying [assumptions](./assumption),
conditionally supported → robust, robust → refuted, and any state → obsolete
severs the claim's meaning.

These rules are part of the
[epistemic protocol layer](./epistemic-protocol-layer) in
[Coscientist](./coscientist). They make knowledge updating explicit and
auditable rather than implicit in prose.
