title: Branched Resolution Map
description:
  Structure showing multiple valid conclusions based on different definitions or
  methods
---

A branched resolution map is a structure that presents multiple valid
conclusions as branches from different starting points: definitions, methods, or
assumptions. Instead of forcing a single answer, it shows "if you define X this
way, then A; if you define X that way, then B."

This is the output format for [knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) when
incompatibility cannot be resolved into a single truth. The map makes explicit
that the disagreement is not about facts but about premises, and readers can see
exactly where conclusions diverge.

Branched maps counter the pressure to average. In standard [RAG](./rag),
conflicting sources get blended into a smooth summary that hides the
disagreement. A branched map preserves the structure of the conflict and lets
the [Operator](./operator) decide which branch applies to their context.
