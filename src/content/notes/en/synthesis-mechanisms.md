title: Synthesis Mechanisms
description: Patterns for making incompatible sources comparable
---

Synthesis mechanisms are the patterns and protocols [Coscientist](./coscientist)
uses to make incompatible sources comparable and to produce structured output
from conflict.

## Core Process

- [Knowledge Synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) — aligning premises, definitions,
  and scope to make disagreements explicit

## Input Patterns

- [Document Collision](./document-collision) — forcing sources to engage with
  each other's claims
- [Contention](./contention) — structured conflict as a first-class object

## Output Patterns

- [Branched Resolution Map](./branched-resolution-map) — showing multiple valid
  conclusions based on different premises
- [Issue Node](./issue-node) — bundling colliding claims for focused resolution

## Analysis Tools

- [Incompatibility Taxonomy](./incompatibility-taxonomy) — classifying why
  sources disagree
- [Minimum Contradiction Set](./minimum-contradiction-set) — finding the core of
  a conflict
- [Minimum Cut](./minimum-cut) — isolating the structure that produces
  contradiction

## Multilingual Dimension

- [Cross-Linguistic Synthesis](./cross-linguistic-synthesis) — combining
  knowledge from multiple languages
- [Language-Agnostic Indexing](./language-agnostic-indexing) — conceptual index
  that transcends specific languages
- [Translation Nuance Loss](./translation-nuance-loss) — tracking what gets lost
  across languages

## Contrast

- [RAG Limitations](./rag-limitations) — why retrieval alone cannot synthesize
