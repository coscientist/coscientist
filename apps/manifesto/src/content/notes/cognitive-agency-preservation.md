title: Cognitive Agency Preservation
description: AI safety framing that keeps humans in control of judgment
---

Cognitive agency preservation is the principle that AI should strengthen human judgment, not replace it. A system preserves agency when it keeps the user in the loop as an active critic: it shows its grounds, surfaces uncertainty, and makes disagreement cheap.

In [Coscientist](./coscientist), this implies traceable claims, explicit rebuttal paths, and a human veto. It is tightly linked to [cognitive sovereignty](./cognitive-sovereignty): the right and obligation to own verification.
