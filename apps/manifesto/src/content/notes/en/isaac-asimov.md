title: Isaac Asimov
description: Science fiction author whose Foundation series inspired Coscientist's vision
---

Isaac Asimov (1920–1992) was a prolific science fiction author and biochemistry
professor whose Foundation series provides the fictional touchstone for
[Coscientist](./coscientist). The series introduced the
[Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica),
[psychohistory](./psychohistory), the [Seldon Plan](./seldon-plan), and the
character [Hari Seldon](./hari-seldon).

The Foundation premise is that the [Galactic Empire](./galactic-empire) will
inevitably fall, leading to a [dark night of the soul](./dark-night-of-the-soul)
lasting millennia. Seldon's response is to create institutions—including the
encyclopedia project on Terminus—that can shorten the dark age by preserving and
producing knowledge.

For [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho), Asimov's fiction is not just inspiration but
a design target: what would it take to build a real knowledge system that could
survive an AI-saturated epistemic environment? The fictional encyclopedia
becomes a specification for [Coscientist](./coscientist): not just preservation
but capability, not just storage but verification. See
[Foundation Fiction](./foundation-fiction) for the cluster of Asimov-derived
concepts.
