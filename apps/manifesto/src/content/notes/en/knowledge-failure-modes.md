title: Knowledge Failure Modes
description: Taxonomy of what can go wrong in knowledge systems
---

Knowledge failure modes are the ways that knowledge systems degrade, collapse,
or mislead. Understanding these modes is prerequisite to designing defenses.

## System-Level Failures

- [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) — knowledge collapse when AI
  takes initiative without human intervention
- [Model Collapse](./model-collapse) — degradation from training on AI-generated
  data
- [Institutional Brain Rot](./institutional-brain-rot) — organizational
  verification capacity decay

## Input-Level Failures

- [AI Slop](./ai-slop) — low-quality AI content flooding the information
  environment
- [Hallucination](./hallucination) — plausible but fabricated AI outputs

## Human-Level Failures

- [Fluency Trap](./fluency-trap) — mistaking smooth prose for accuracy
- [AI-Induced Illusions of Competence](./ai-induced-illusions-of-competence) —
  false mastery from AI assistance
- [Deskilling Through AI Delegation](./deskilling-through-ai-delegation) —
  losing capacity by not practicing

## Semantic Failures

- [Semantic Drift](./semantic-drift) — changes in meaning over time
- [Definition Drift](./definition-drift) — meaning shifts over time
- [Meaning Loss](./meaning-loss) — claims becoming obsolete as terms change
