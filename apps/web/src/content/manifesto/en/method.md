title: Method
description: "The procedure used to generate evidence or conclusions"
---

A method is the procedure by which evidence is gathered or a conclusion is
derived: the experimental design, measurement protocol, statistical analysis, or
logical derivation. Claims inherit the strengths and weaknesses of their
methods.

Method matters because the same conclusion can rest on very different grounds.
Two studies that agree on results may both be wrong if they share a
methodological flaw. This is why
[exploration strategies](./exploration-strategies) include method–conclusion
coupling: clustering claims by method rather than by conclusion to detect shared
vulnerabilities.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), methods are nodes connected to
claims and evidence. An [undercut](./undercut) can target the method, arguing
that the procedure was flawed even if the data were accurately reported.
