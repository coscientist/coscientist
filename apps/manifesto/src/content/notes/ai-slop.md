title: AI Slop
description: Low-quality AI-generated content flooding the internet
---

AI slop (or simply slop) is low-effort, high-volume content produced with generative models: text, images, videos, and even books optimized for throughput rather than meaning. The term borrows "slop" as a pejorative for output that is cheap to produce but costly to sift through; [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) describes it as low-quality digital content produced in quantity using AI.

In practice, slop includes absurd short-form videos, uncanny advertising imagery, AI-written books of questionable originality, plausible fake news, and engagement bait that exploits tragedy or outrage. Once the label exists, it tends to generalize ("architecture slop," "wordslop") and to attach to behavior ("sloppers" who default to generation instead of thinking).

The deeper issue is epistemic: slop raises the background noise of the internet, inflates the cost of verification, and pushes systems toward self-referential drift. In that sense it is adjacent to both [model collapse](./model-collapse) (contaminated training data) and [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) (contaminated knowledge bases).
