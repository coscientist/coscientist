description: The vision of an externalized cognitive exoskeleton that amplifies human intelligence

Superbrain is [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s term for the vision of a [cognitive exoskeleton](./cognitive-exoskeleton) that amplifies human intelligence beyond biological limits. [Extracranial](./extracranial) is described as an "Exosuit for Superbrains": an externalized memory extension meant to contain every idea the user has.

The superbrain is not a replacement for human cognition but an amplifier. It stores what cannot be held in memory, retrieves what would otherwise be lost, performs search and comparison at scales impossible for unaided thought, and operates across languages through a [multilingual knowledge mesh](./multilingual-knowledge-mesh). The human remains sovereign; the system handles the mechanical labor.

The multilingual dimension is crucial. A superbrain constrained to one [Sprachraum](./sprachraum) is fundamentally limited. True cognitive amplification means thinking [across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums), accessing knowledge regardless of which language it was originally recorded in, and synthesizing insights through [cross-linguistic synthesis](./cross-linguistic-synthesis).

[Coscientist](./coscientist) is the research-oriented instantiation of this vision: a multi-agent [LLM](./llm) system that functions as a virtual research collaborator, capable of reading literature in any language and debating hypotheses through its tournament of Generators, Reflectors, Rankers, and Evolvers. The superbrain dream is not distant science fiction; it is the design target.
