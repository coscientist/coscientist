description: Fictional mathematician who created psychohistory in Asimov's Foundation
---

Hari Seldon is the fictional mathematician in [Isaac Asimov](./isaac-asimov)'s
Foundation series who developed [psychohistory](./psychohistory) and designed
the [Seldon Plan](./seldon-plan). Recognizing that the
[Galactic Empire](./galactic-empire) would inevitably collapse, he established
the Foundation on Terminus, ostensibly to compile the
[Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica), but secretly to seed
humanity's recovery.

Seldon's approach combines prediction with intervention: psychohistory reveals
probable futures, and carefully placed institutions can steer toward better
outcomes. The encyclopedia project is both genuine and instrumental .

For [Coscientist](./coscientist), Seldon represents the architect who sees
beyond preservation to capability. A knowledge system that merely stores is
vulnerable; one that can verify, update, and produce understanding has a chance
of surviving the [dark night of the soul](./dark-night-of-the-soul). The
[Operator](./operator) role in Coscientist echoes Seldon's position: sovereign
over knowledge, responsible for structure, and accountable for outcomes.
