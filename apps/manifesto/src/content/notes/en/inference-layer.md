title: Inference Layer
description: The living, evolving claim network in a dialectical graph
---

The inference layer is the living, evolving network of [claims](./claim),
[attacks](./attack), [undercuts](./undercut), and supporting relations in a
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph). It represents the current state of
knowledge: what is believed, what is contested, and what has been refuted.

Unlike the [narrative layer](./narrative-layer), which produces human-readable
documents, the inference layer is a graph structure optimized for reasoning and
updating. When new evidence arrives, the inference layer changes; narratives are
regenerated as needed.

This separation is why [Coscientist](./coscientist) treats documents as
projections, not ground truth. A document is a snapshot of the inference layer
at a point in time. The living knowledge is in the graph; the prose is a
rendering.
