title: Responsibility Line
description: The traceable chain of who asserted what and on what grounds
---

The responsibility line is the traceable chain of who asserted what and on what
grounds. When a sentence can be walked back to its source, method, and author,
errors remain correctable; when that chain is missing, correction becomes social
friction and the system drifts.

It is a foundational constraint in an
[epistemic protocol layer](./epistemic-protocol-layer) and fits naturally with a
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), where claims and citations are
explicit objects rather than implied by prose.
