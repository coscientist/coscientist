title: Forgetting Curve
description: The predictable decline of memory without review
---

The forgetting curve describes the predictable decline in recall when information is not revisited. The exact shape varies by material and person, but the qualitative point is stable: soon after learning, loss is rapid, then it slows.

Techniques like [Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) work by placing review near the steep part of the drop-off, and [Retrieval Practice](./retrieval-practice) works by making that review active rather than passive.
