title: Second Brain
description: A personal knowledge management approach for externalizing ideas
---

The "second brain" is a personal knowledge management approach focused on
capturing, organizing, and retrieving notes outside the mind. In practice it
often emphasizes workflows and curation: inboxes, categories, tagging, and
periodic review.

It overlaps with a [digital garden](./digital-garden) and a
[digital brain](./digital-brain), but "second brain" tends to name the practice,
while the others name the artifact and its public/private form.
