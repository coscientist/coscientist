title: Argumentative Act
description: A move in reasoning such as asserting, defining, or rebutting
---

An argumentative act is a distinct move in reasoning, such as asserting a claim,
defining a term, providing evidence, rebutting, or undercutting an assumption.
The point of naming the act is that the same sentence can play different roles
depending on context: claim, evidence, definition, or critique.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), these acts are stored as explicit
objects , not just as raw text, so later synthesis can track what was said, on
what grounds, and how it was challenged.

See [Dialectical Graph Nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes) and
[Dialectical Graph Edges](./dialectical-graph-edges).
