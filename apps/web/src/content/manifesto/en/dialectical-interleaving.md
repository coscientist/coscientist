title: Dialectical Interleaving

  Mixing claim types during exploration to prevent silos and puncture false
  competence

Dialectical interleaving is the practice of mixing [claim](./claim) types,
domains, and sources during exploration rather than reviewing one topic
exhaustively before moving to another. It applies the learning science principle
of [interleaving](./interleaving) to knowledge verification.

The benefit is discrimination: when you see claims from different contexts in
sequence, you notice when a pattern that seems universal actually depends on
hidden [assumptions](./assumption) or [scope](./scope). You also avoid the silo
effect where reviewing only one viewpoint creates
[illusions of competence](./illusions-of-competence).

In [exploration strategies](./exploration-strategies), dialectical interleaving
means alternating between supporting evidence and [attacks](./attack), between
different [methods](./method), and between friendly and hostile sources. The
[Operator](./operator) builds a more robust map of the territory.
