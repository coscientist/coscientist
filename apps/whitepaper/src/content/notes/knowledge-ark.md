title: Knowledge Ark
description: A repository designed to preserve knowledge through collapse
---

A knowledge ark is a repository designed to preserve and transmit knowledge through periods of civilizational decline. The ark metaphor emphasizes not just storage but continuity: sources, methods, and context must survive so future readers can re-derive conclusions rather than merely inherit claims.

The [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) is a fictional example of this trope, and the term has a broader history in discussions of cultural preservation (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_ark).
