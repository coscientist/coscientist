description: The mechanisms for checking claims against evidence and counterevidence
---

The verification system is the set of mechanisms [Coscientist](./coscientist)
uses to check [claims](./claim) against evidence, counterevidence, and
alternative explanations. It is not a single tool but a coordinated suite of
protocols and practices.

## Core Components

- [Verification](./verification) — the process of checking claims
- [Rebuttal-First Search](./rebuttal-first-search) — seeking counterevidence
  before acceptance
- [Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol) — using model
  disagreement as a signal
- [Unanimity Requirement](./unanimity-requirement) — accepting claims only when
  all reviewers agree
- [Responsibility Line](./responsibility-line) — tracing who asserted what
- [Counterexample](./counterexample) — cases that break claims
- [Zero-Trust Ingestion](./zero-trust-ingestion) — requiring provenance before
  authority

The system is designed to keep
[correction cheaper than drift](./correction-vs-drift) and to support
[desirable difficulty](./desirable-difficulty-in-verification) so that the
[Operator](./operator) remains engaged.
