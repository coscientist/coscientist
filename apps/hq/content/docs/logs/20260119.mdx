## HQ Title Auto-Rendering from Frontmatter

**Scope**: `apps/hq`

### Changes Made

| File | Change |
| ---- | ------ |
| `app/[lang]/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` | Added `<h1>{page.data.title}</h1>` before MDX content to auto-render title from frontmatter |
| `content/docs/index.mdx` | Removed duplicate `# H1` heading since title now renders from frontmatter |

### Technical Decisions

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Previously, HQ pages required both frontmatter `title` (for metadata/sidebar) AND manual `# H1` (for page display). This created duplication and maintenance burden.

2. **Auto-Render Pattern**: Modified `page.tsx` to render the frontmatter title as an `<h1>` element before the MDX content. Now authors only need to set `title` in frontmatter.

3. **Deduplication**: Removed the explicit `# H1` from `index.mdx` which previously had both frontmatter title and H1, preventing duplicate titles on the page.

### Before vs After

| Before | After |
| ------ | ----- |
| Set `title` in frontmatter | Set `title` in frontmatter |
| Manually add `# H1` in content | (automatic) |
| Edit both when title changes | Edit frontmatter only |
