title: Cognitive Exoskeleton
description: External tools that extend and amplify human cognition
---

A cognitive exoskeleton is a system of external tools that extend and amplify
human cognition: storing what cannot be held in memory, retrieving what would
otherwise be lost, and performing search and comparison at scales impossible for
unaided thought.

The term evokes physical exoskeletons that amplify strength without replacing
the body. A cognitive exoskeleton does the same for the mind: it assists rather
than replaces, keeping the human in control of judgment while offloading
mechanical labor.

[Vannevar Bush](./vannevar-bush)'s [Memex](./memex) was an early vision of such
an exoskeleton. [Coscientist](./coscientist) aims to be a more capable one: not
just storing and linking, but performing
[contemplation labor](./contemplation-labor), surfacing contradictions, and
defending against [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) while
preserving [cognitive sovereignty](./cognitive-sovereignty). The
[Superbrain](./superbrain) vision extends this to a
[multilingual knowledge mesh](./multilingual-knowledge-mesh) that operates
[across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums), thinking in multiple
languages simultaneously.
