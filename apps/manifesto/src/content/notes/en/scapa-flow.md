title: Scapa Flow
description: Scottish naval base where scuttled WWI warships became a source of low-background steel

Scapa Flow is a natural harbor in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, where the German
High Seas Fleet was scuttled on June 21, 1919, following World War I. Seventy-four
warships sank that day, and their steel—manufactured before the nuclear age—later
became the world's premier source of [low-background steel](./low-background-steel).

The steel's value was not apparent until decades after the scuttling. Once
atmospheric nuclear testing began in 1945 and contaminated global steel
production with radioactive isotopes, pre-war steel became essential for
building radiation-sensitive equipment. The Scapa Flow wrecks, protected
underwater from fallout, contained thousands of tons of uncontaminated metal.

Salvage operations have extracted steel for Geiger counters, whole-body medical
scanners, particle physics experiments, and reportedly NASA's Voyager probes.
The irony is precise: ships built for one war became valuable because of weapons
developed in the next.

Today Scapa Flow represents a finite, depleting resource. As a
[pre-contamination resource](./pre-contamination-resource), its steel cannot be
replaced—only exhausted.
