# Encyclopedia Meltdown

Encyclopedia Meltdown is a knowledge-collapse phenomenon that begins when the initiative and control of writing transfers entirely to AI, without the [Galarch](./galarch)'s conscious intervention.

## Origin

The term comes from an essay by [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho).

## The Mechanism

Meltdown typically involves the coupling of three loops:

### 1. The Generation-Citation Loop
Statements produced by the model re-enter as model input and become treated as "facts that existed."

### 2. The Linkage-Authority Loop
Internal links are consumed not as verification pathways but as trust badges. Link density becomes a proxy for accuracy.

### 3. The Responsibility-No-Agent Loop
The less traceable it is who wrote what on what grounds, the higher the cost of correction becomes. Eventually the system converges to an "approximately maintained false steady state."

## Consequences

- The act of writing becomes meaningless
- Hallucination squares itself without verification
- Errors and contradictions run away into exponential growth
- Minor errors propagate through self-amplification across the entire knowledge network
- Links manufacture trust, repackaging contamination as authority
- The line of responsibility becomes vague
- The entire encyclopedia degenerates into a meaningless heap of low-grade data

## The Core Problem

Because an encyclopedia is a mechanism in which links themselves manufacture trust, once it is contaminated, the contamination is repackaged as authority. When the attitude "it must be right because the encyclopedia linked it" takes hold, human contemplation degenerates from verification into mere ratification.

## Prevention

The first principle of [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) design: **sovereignty over knowledge must remain with the [Galarch](./galarch)**. Prevention strategies implemented in [Coscientist](./coscientist) include the [Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol) and building a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) that separates truth from narrative.
