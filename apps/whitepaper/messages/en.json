    "whatIs": "What is Coscientist?",
    "whatIsDescription": "An always-working, readily-available AI service for knowledge work across personal essay databases, technical notes, engineering design history, and frontier scientific research.",
    "intro1": "I built my first digital brain for a personal reason. I wanted a place where my thoughts could stay alive long enough to matter. I wanted ideas to compound instead of evaporate into scattered drafts, half-finished notes, and the quiet entropy that follows busy weeks.",
    "intro2": "In the beginning, the enemy looked like friction. Too many tools asked me to become a librarian of my own life. They made thinking feel like filing. So I built a workspace that tried to get out of my way. I wrote about next-gen digital brains as an engineering problem: reduce overhead, automate structure, let the human remain in the state where they can write and connect ideas without constant gardening.",
    "intro3": "That chapter mattered. It taught me what continuous capture can do when the cost of capture is low. It also taught me what breaks: any system that demands too much ceremony will be abandoned, and abandoned tools do not compound.",
    "worldChanged": "Then the world changed.",
    "worldChanged1": "Generative AI made writing cheap. Not slightly easier, but fundamentally cheap. Cheap enough that the volume of plausible text stopped being a sign of intelligence. Cheap enough that the center of gravity shifted from producing words to protecting meaning. Cheap enough that the real risk was no longer I cannot get my thoughts out, but",
    "forgetKnowing": "I will forget what it means to know.",
    "forgetKnowingTitle": "Cheap output and degradation of knowing",
    "forgetKnowingDescription": "When writing becomes cheap, humans naturally substitute produced something for understood something. This is not moral failure; it is cognitive economics. If the environment offers a low-cost substitute for a high-cost act (verification), most people drift toward the substitute, especially under time pressure. Coscientist treats this as the central design problem. It assumes the default outcome of mainstream AI is not a single falsehood, but a behavioral transition: the user stops reconstructing reasons and starts accepting coherence. The product must be structured so that coherence does not masquerade as justification.",
    "dangerousFail": "In that new world, the most dangerous failure is not a single hallucination. It is the slow transition from verification to endorsement. It is when smoothness becomes authority. It is when the human stops reconstructing why something should be believed and starts approving whatever looks coherent. This is how a mind rots without noticing: not through stupidity, but through convenience.",
    "meltdownIntro": "That realization forced a more defensive and more serious approach. I began describing a collapse mode I call",

    "meltdownItem1": "AI becomes the default author",
    "meltdownItem2": "Internal links create false coherence",
    "meltdownItem3": "Humans stop verifying and start approving",
    "meltdownDescription2": "Small errors get amplified by referencing. The corpus becomes coherent but unauditable. Solution: preserve provenance, forbid circular elevation, gate escalation behind human verification.",
    "meltdownExplain": "It is systemic, not incidental. It happens when AI becomes the default author and the human becomes the default approver; when errors enter quietly, link structures amplify them, and responsibility lines blur until the entire corpus looks coherent but cannot be trusted. The corpus does not only become wrong. It becomes unauditable. It becomes epistemically ungovernable.",
    "myResponse": "Coscientist is my response.",
    "coscientistDescription": "Coscientist is an always-on AI service for knowledge. It runs constantly, but it does not compete for attention. It does not beg. It does not perform. It does not try to outpace the human. It works continuously in the background (indexing, organizing, cross-checking, preparing contradiction maps, drafting verification plans) and then it waits for",
    "momentVerifies": "the moment a human verifies.",
    "alwaysOnTitle": "Always-on, quiet-in-attention",
    "alwaysOnDescription": "Always-on can mean computational (keeps working without prompts) or psychological (competing for attention via notifications and nudges). Coscientist is the former, not the latter. An epistemic tool that competes for attention will eventually compete for belief. Inspired by Mark Weiser's calm technology: recede to the periphery, move to center only when needed. Compute more, demand less.",
    "tagline": "Not AGI but close enough.",
    "taglineTitle": "What the tagline commits to",
    "taglineDescription1": "The line is a joke with boundaries. It signals that the goal is not autonomy for its own sake, and not a system that invents goals. The goal is a co-worker that:",
    "taglineItem1": "keeps working when the human is offline (preparing cross-checks, surfacing contradictions)",
    "taglineItem2": "remains accountable to evidence paths (responsibility lines)",
    "taglineItem3": "waits for human verification before escalating claims to knowledge",
    "taglineItem4": "improves research throughput by tying narrative to execution artifacts",
    "taglineDescription2": "In other words: close enough to feel like a co-scientist, not close enough to replace the human's role in deciding what is true and what is worth doing.",
    "taglineExplain": "It is a playful line with a strict intention. I am not building a mythology project. I am building a reliable co-worker for thinking: a system that can keep working even when I am tired, keep track of what I forgot, and keep my knowledge honest when the environment makes dishonesty effortless.",
    "protectsAgency": "What Coscientist protects is not productivity. It protects agency.",
    "agencyExplain": "In the attention economy, helpful products often succeed by becoming emotionally or behaviorally sticky. Coscientist refuses that game. It is always running, but it remains calm in the user's mind. It is pullable on demand and",
    "quietDefault": "quiet by default",
    "quietExplain": ", not because silence is aesthetic, but because silence is safety. If a system has the power to shape your beliefs, it cannot be allowed to shape your attention with the same intensity that it shapes your output.",
    "responsibilityLine": "responsibility line.",
    "responsibilityTitle": "Responsibility line",
    "responsibilityDescription": "In software, provenance is non-negotiable: version control, build logs, SBOMs. Knowledge work needs the same. A responsibility line captures who asserted a claim, what sources ground it, what assumptions apply, and what uncertainty remains. Without this, errors become diffuse vibes impossible to localize. If the line is missing, Coscientist downgrades status (knowledge to hypothesis) rather than filling gaps with narrative.",
    "responsibilityExplain": "The backbone of Coscientist is a simple rule: no claim graduates into knowledge without a responsibility line. A statement is not knowledge because it is beautifully written. A statement is not knowledge because the model is confident. A statement is not knowledge because four other models agreed. A statement becomes knowledge only when its justification can be traced (cleanly, explicitly, and without circularity) back to sources, evidence spans, methods, assumptions, scope, and uncertainty. If the chain is missing, the statement is downgraded into a hypothesis, and the missing steps are made visible rather than hidden inside confident prose.",
    "differentProduct": "This is a very different kind of AI product.",
    "differentExplain": "Most AI systems treat the answer as the destination. Coscientist treats the justification as the destination. Answers are cheap. Justification is the scarce artifact. That is why Coscientist is designed to do thinking work rather than writing work. Its primary job is not to fill blank pages with text. Its job is to preserve the conditions under which a human can still know what they know.",
    "separates": "To do that, Coscientist separates",
    "narrativeInference": "narrative from inference.",
    "undercutTitle": "Why undercut matters",
    "undercutDescription1": "Most systems treat disagreement as symmetrical: A says X, B says not-X. Real scientific progress often happens through undercutting: showing that a premise, method, definition, or measurement invalidates an inference even if the conclusion remains psychologically appealing.",
    "undercutDescription2": "This is why Coscientist distinguishes: contradiction (cannot both be true), rebuttal (direct opposition to a claim), undercut (attack on the support structure that makes a claim persuasive).",
    "undercutDescription3": "Argumentation theory has formal models for this (e.g., abstract argumentation frameworks), but the core intuition is simple: if the support structure is fragile, the conclusion must be treated as fragile even before it is proven false.",
    "narrative": "Narrative",
    "narrativeExplain": "is what humans read: essays, memos, briefings, living papers. Narrative is the surface.",
    "inference": "Inference",
    "inferenceExplain": "is the substrate that makes narrative safe. Raw excerpts are preserved as immutable spans. Claims are normalized propositions derived from spans or explicitly asserted by the user. Each claim is bound to scope constraints, assumptions, definitions, methods, data pointers, and uncertainty metadata. Relations between claims are explicit: support, contradiction, and undercut: not just disagree, but your premise is unstable, or your method cannot justify your conclusion.",
    "distinctionMatters": "This distinction matters because the AI era has created a new kind of epistemic fraud: not intentional deception, but structural deception. A large corpus can sound coherent while being logically hollow. A summary can feel faithful while quietly drifting from what the sources truly support. Retrieval systems can surface many citations and still fail to represent how those citations relate:",
    "whetherUndercuts": "whether one undercuts another.",
    "ragFailTitle": "Why retrieval-only fails",
    "ragFailDescription1": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves grounding by retrieving relevant text. But grounding is not the same as reasoning. The failure modes that matter for knowledge integrity include:",
    "ragFailItem1": "Quantity bias: many weak sources can drown out a single decisive refutation.",
    "ragFailItem2": "Relation blindness: retrieved excerpts are not structured into supports / undercuts / outdated / different scope.",
    "ragFailItem3": "Attribution drift: quotes containing citations can cause misattribution (the system treats a quoted claim as the author's claim).",
    "ragFailDescription2": "Coscientist's approach is to treat retrieval as the intake step, not the epistemic step. The epistemic step is relation modeling and responsibility-line preservation.",
    "narrativeOutrun": "If narrative is allowed to outrun inference, the tool becomes a persuasion engine instead of a knowledge engine.",
    "preventDrift": "Coscientist is built to prevent that drift by design.",
    "usefulPlaces": "It is also built to be useful in the places where knowledge matters most: personal identity and frontier science.",
    "personalSide": "On the personal side, Coscientist becomes a living essay archive. It preserves your writing with stable attribution to original passages. It lets you ask questions about your own thinking without rewriting history. It can show you what you believed in 2019 and how you argued for it, and it can show you where your definitions shifted without pretending the past was wrong or the present is final. It can surface tensions across years, but it will not resolve them by inventing a new voice. It keeps your voice intact.",
    "scientificSide": "On the scientific side, Coscientist becomes a ScienceOps workspace. It ingests papers, code, datasets, lab notes, and experiment logs. It turns literature into claim sets with provenance. It proposes verification strategies and experiment plans. It ties narrative conclusions to runnable artifacts. It pushes toward the discipline that software learned the hard way:",
    "reproducibility": "reproducibility is the minimum bar.",
    "scienceOpsTitle": "ScienceOps: accelerating science",
    "scienceOpsDescription1": "The ScienceOps posture borrows directly from software operations: research outputs must be runnable, comparable, and versioned. Otherwise, knowledge cannot compound; it merely accumulates.",
    "scienceOpsDescription2": "Coscientist treats papers, code, data, parameters, and results as a single artifact family rather than separate stuff. The narrative is not the product; the reproducible path is. Coscientist's aim is not to replace domain science. It is to provide the infrastructure that makes domain science faster to verify and easier to build upon.",
    "ambitionConverge": "This is where my long-term ambition and my epistemic ambition converge.",
    "hardProblems": "For years, I have felt that many of humanity's hardest problems persist not because we lack ideas, but because we lack operational infrastructure. We have brilliant people and good ideas, yet implementation is slow, verification is brittle, and dissemination is clogged by formats that do not preserve execution paths. In software, we learned to build pipelines (version control, CI/CD, dependency management, containerization) because we had no choice. Complexity forced discipline. Science, in many domains, still lives in a pre-pipeline world where conclusions travel faster than the machinery needed to reproduce them.",
    "bringMachinery": "Coscientist is my attempt to bring that machinery into the everyday act of knowing.",
    "machineryExplain": "It does not require everyone to become a philosopher. It simply makes the responsible act easier. It keeps the paper trail intact. It makes uncertainty explicit. It preserves what must be preserved so that correction remains possible.",
    "remainsCalm": "And it does this while remaining calm.",
    "calmExplain": "The system runs constantly, but it is patient. It produces preparation, not pressure. It does not attempt to replace the human's role as epistemic governor. It does not try to win the race to the finish line, because the finish line is not speed. The finish line is trustworthy progress.",
    "ifWorks": "If this works, it changes the rhythm of knowledge work.",
    "rhythmExplain": "Verification stops feeling like a punishment and starts feeling like momentum, because the system has already prepared the cross-checks, the rebuttals, the undercuts, and the minimal tests that would actually move the claim from plausible to stable. Research stops feeling like artisanal heroism and starts feeling like a disciplined loop, because the narrative remains tied to runnable artifacts. Collaboration stops feeling like a game of trust and starts feeling like a shared responsibility line,",

    "ragCollects": "Standard RAG collects excerpts and stitches them into sentences; a dialectical graph isolates excerpts as evidence nodes, then builds claim nodes and relation edges above them to separate source, meaning, and role. The problem that meaning changes when an excerpt is truncated is structurally blocked by never treating the excerpt itself as a claim in the first place.",

    "whyUndercuts": "Why undercuts matters",
    "whyUndercutsContent1": "In particular, undercuts is an area standard RAG can barely handle. It must represent not \"the conclusion is wrong,\" but \"the method, assumption, or definition that supports the conclusion is undermined,\" because only then can knowledge update.",
    "whyUndercutsContent2": "The direct effect of this structure is the removal of provenance ambiguity. In a situation where B cites A while mentioning that X works, an excerpt can be truncated so it looks like B's claim. Once the evidence node carries the source and exact span, the claim node separately records who asserted what, and the cites edge explicitly represents B to A, that error disappears.",
    "contradictionFirst": "Contradiction-First Search",
    "contradictionFirstIntro": "The second key is a search bias that prioritizes contradictions and counterexamples rather than consensus. Majority vote does not guarantee knowledge quality. A single counterexample, a single rebuttal, or a single definition revision at a turning point often contains more information than hundreds of repeated statements.",
    "maximizeAttacking": "maximize attacking edges",
    "adversarialTitle": "Adversarial Knowledge Building",
    "adversarialDesc": "Rather than seeking confirmation, the system actively hunts for refutations. This is not negativity—it is the scientific method formalized into graph operations.",
    "claimConditioned": "A dialectical graph structurally privileges that information. When a claim node is created, the system's default behavior is not to gather supporting grounds, but to maximize attacking edges. When a counterexample attaches, the claim is not discarded; it is conditioned. \"Always true\" descends to \"true under conditions.\" \"Mostly true\" decomposes into \"true under sample constraints.\"",
    "argumentTheory": "What is required here is not merely a KG, but computational rules coupled with argumentation theory. Coscientist cannot settle for simply deciding winners and losers of arguments. Attack types must differ, and the reasons an attack failed must also be stored. Rebuttals are often invalidated by definition mismatch, out-of-scope application, measurement mismatch, methodological defects, replication failure, and the like. This invalidation must be recorded as edges in the argument graph.",
    "qualityOverQuantity": "Quality Over Quantity",
    "qualityIntro": "The third key is an evaluation axis that does not replace quality with quantity. Standard RAG's 100-to-1 problem begins the moment one decides conclusions by counting search results. A dialectical graph stores quality dimensions separately for each piece of evidence.",
    "qualityAxes": "Method fit, data size and bias, reproducibility, independent verification, the existence of subsequent rebuttals, the stability of definitions, and measurement reliability are independent axes.

    "knowledgeSynthesisSection": "Knowledge Synthesis",
    "synthesisIntro": "Standard RAG is strong at retrieval and weak at synthesis because it has no internal object called contention. In a dialectical graph, contention is a first-class citizen. Issue nodes bundle what conflicts with what, and they record the conditions under which the issue can be resolved.",
    "synthesisDecompose": "When A and B are incompatible, the system does not merely list both; it decomposes the cause of incompatibility into definition differences, sampling differences, method differences, scope differences, time-driven nonstationarity, and so on. Resolution is not a single answer; it appears as a branched map.",
    "synthesisNotAveraging": "Synthesis is not averaging",
    "synthesisTitle": "True Synthesis",
    "synthesisDesc": "Synthesis is aligning premises and scope by translating them into the same coordinate system. It requires understanding why sources disagree before attempting to reconcile them.",
    "synthesisExplain": "If the same term X yields different conclusions under different definitions, the system first records the branching of definition before treating it as a contradiction in conclusion. This enables synthesis. Synthesis is not averaging; it is aligning premises and scope by translating them into the same coordinate system.",

    "preventionIntro": "A graph-based system prevents meltdown by separating two layers:",
    "inferenceLayer": "First, the inference layer is the truth graph itself.",
    "narrativeLayer": "Second, the narrative layer is a projection of the truth graph at a specific time.",
    "documentSnapshot": "A document is not final truth, but a snapshot of the graph. Every sentence in a document must be able to backtrack to a path in the graph, and each sentence must have a grounds path. That path is not a simple bibliography; it is a chained structure that runs through claim, assumption, method, data, evidence span, and source.",
    "theRule": "The Rule",
    "theRuleContent": "Without this chain, a sentence is just a sentence, not knowledge. This single rule blocks the main channel of meltdown, where AI replaces compilation by producing smooth sentences in bulk.",

    "counterexampleFirst": "Counterexample-first search.",
    "counterexampleFirstDesc": "Popularity is treated not as evidence of quality, but as evidence of risk. The more frequently a claim is cited, the more the system prioritizes collecting its counterexamples and boundary conditions, because contamination from popular claims has larger blast radius.",
    "minCut": "Contradiction minimum-cut search.",
    "minCutDesc": "When claim sets conflict, find the minimal set of edges and premises that produce the conflict. That minimal set becomes the target of contemplation. Human time must be invested in the minimum contradiction set. AI handles broad search, candidate generation, and minimum-cut computation; humans judge the legitimacy of definitions and premises.",
    "definitionDrift": "Definition drift detection.",
    "definitionDriftDesc": "When the meaning of the same term shifts subtly across time, schools, or fields, the graph records changes in definition nodes and moves old documents' claims into a meaning-loss state. This counters RAG's most common error: assuming the same word implies the same concept.",
    "methodConclusion": "Method-conclusion coupling verification.",
    "methodConclusionDesc": "Cluster claim groups around methods rather than conclusions. Different conclusions can share the same flaw, and identical conclusions can have different strengths of grounds. This moves toward a model in which knowledge quality depends not on the direction of a conclusion, but on the durability of the path that produced it.",
    "replicationPath": "Replication path separation.",
    "replicationPathDesc": "Support is computed not by repeating the same conclusion, but by whether the conclusion was reached through independent paths. The same dataset, the same code, the same lab, or the same theoretical assumptions count as a single path. This is a graph-level mechanism for removing the illusion of majority vote.",
    "editorRole": "The Editor's Role",
    "editorRoleIntro": "On a dialectical graph with these operating principles, the contemplation AI of Coscientist does not simply output answers. Instead, it produces issues, refines conditions, structures rebuttals, and creates a coordinate system that can be synthesized. Inter-document agreement arrives as a byproduct, not as the goal.",
    "mapContradictions": "The goal is a map of contradictions and an explicit statement of resolution conditions. The more this map is secured, the more future research or records can update knowledge by rearrangement rather than rewriting.",
    "editorInitiative": "if the editor maintains initiative over contemplation",
    "editorInitiativeTitle": "The Editor as Structure Supervisor",
    "editorInitiativeDesc": "The editor's job shifts from writing sentences to overseeing the structural integrity of the knowledge graph. They become a supervisor of arguments, not a producer of prose.",
    "editorConclusion": "Finally, this clarifies the editor's role. If AI takes initiative over writing, that is meltdown; but if the editor maintains initiative over contemplation and uses AI as a tool for contemplation, the editor is freed from sentence labor and becomes a supervisor of structure.",
    "ecosystem": "In that state, Coscientist can successfully prevent meltdown, and it can be operated not as a collection of documents, but as an ecosystem of arguments."
