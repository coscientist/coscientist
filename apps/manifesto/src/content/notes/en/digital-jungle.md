title: Digital Jungle
description: A low-friction personal knowledge space that self-organizes
---

A digital jungle is a personal knowledge space that grows with minimal manual
curation. It relies on automation to surface structure through backlinks,
search, and algorithmic association rather than constant tending.

Where a [digital garden](./digital-garden) implies ongoing manual cultivation, a
jungle tries to self-organize as you write. The idea is developed in
[Creating Next-gen Digital Brains](./creating-next-gen-digital-brains) and shows
up in systems like [Extracranial](./extracranial).
