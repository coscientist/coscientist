title: Multi-AI Consensus Protocol

The Multi-AI Consensus Protocol is a collaboration workflow in which the [Galarch](./galarch) plus multiple mainstream AIs work together to reduce single-model hallucination risk and prevent [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown).

In the "1+4" variant, one human coordinates four AI systems (as of December 2025: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok). Each AI has independent conversational memory, but the protocol treats memory diversity as a weak proxy for evidence diversity; what matters is forcing explicit disagreement and traceability.

Operationally, revisions are accepted at the unit of assertion (sentence, paragraph, or document) only when they reach unanimity; uncertainty must remain explicit; provenance metadata must be traceable; and rebuttal search is deliberate rather than optional. The protocol is also cultural: it trains the habit of asking "what would change my mind?"

This is not a proof of truth. Models share training data and can converge on correlated failure modes, so agreement can reflect shared bias; the cost of unanimity can push writing into hedging; and independent memories do not guarantee independent evidence channels. In one multi-AI review of the protocol, it received 2 approvals, 1 objection, and 1 hold—suggesting it needs reinforcement with stronger rebuttal procedures and rules for evidence independence.
