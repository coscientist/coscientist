title: Personal to Institutional Knowledge
description: Scaling personal knowledge practices to organizations
---

Personal to institutional knowledge is the transition from a
[digital brain](./digital-brain) serving one person to a system serving a team,
lab, or organization. What works for personal notes does not automatically
scale: governance, shared vocabulary, and trust boundaries become first-order
concerns.

A personal system can tolerate ambiguity because the user knows their own
context. An institutional system must make [provenance](./provenance) explicit,
enforce [traceability](./traceability), and handle disagreement among
contributors. This is why [Coscientist](./coscientist) emphasizes the
[epistemic protocol layer](./epistemic-protocol-layer) as a
[knowledge constitution](./knowledge-constitution).

[ScienceOps](./scienceops) is one instantiation of this transition: applying
personal knowledge habits to research teams, with added tooling for
reproducibility and audit. The
[natural science engineer](./natural-science-engineer) is the role that bridges
the personal and institutional scales.
