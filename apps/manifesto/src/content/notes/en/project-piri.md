description: A cancelled initiative for unlimited translations of programming documentation
---

Project PIRI was [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s initiative to provide
unlimited translations of major programming and developer documentation. The
motto: "Become a 10x dev without learning English."

The project embodied the [across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums)
vision in a practical domain. Technical documentation is overwhelmingly
English-centric, creating a barrier for developers worldwide. PIRI aimed to
remove this barrier by making documentation accessible in any language, enabling
developers to focus on learning to code rather than learning English first.

**The project was cancelled.** AI coding agents became powerful enough to render
the original premise obsolete. When an AI can help someone write code directly
in their native language, translating English documentation becomes unnecessary.
The barrier PIRI aimed to break was broken by a different force entirely.

This outcome was concerning rather than celebratory. It demonstrated how quickly
AI capabilities can obsolete well-intentioned human infrastructure projects.
What took months to design and build became irrelevant not because it failed,
but because the problem it solved evaporated. The speed of this shift raises
deeper questions about the stability of any knowledge infrastructure in an era
of rapid AI advancement.

For [Coscientist](./coscientist), PIRI remains a cautionary tale: systems
designed around current AI limitations may become obsolete as those limitations
disappear. The [across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums) vision
persists, but its implementation must account for AI capabilities that change
faster than human projects can adapt.
