title: Active Recall
description: Studying by retrieving information from memory
---

Active recall is studying by trying to produce the answer from memory instead of re-reading or highlighting. Done well, it feels effortful: you close the notes, attempt the recall, then check and repair what you missed.

It is a concrete form of [Retrieval Practice](./retrieval-practice) and pairs naturally with [Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition): recall is the act, spacing is the schedule. It also punctures [Illusions of Competence](./illusions-of-competence) by making gaps visible early.
