title: Definition Drift
description: When a term's meaning shifts across time or contexts
---

Definition drift is the gradual shift in meaning of a term across time, schools, or fields. It creates false agreement and false contradiction when the same word is used for different concepts—people appear to argue about conclusions when they are actually talking past one another.

In [Coscientist](./coscientist), drift is tracked explicitly by separating definition objects from claims. When a term changes meaning, old claims can be marked as meaning-lost or re-scoped instead of being silently mixed into a single "consensus."
