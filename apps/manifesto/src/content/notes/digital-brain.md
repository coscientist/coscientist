title: Digital Brain
description: A personal knowledge system that mirrors and extends a mind
---

A digital brain is a personal knowledge system designed to capture, link, and evolve ideas over time, acting as a cognitive exoskeleton rather than a static archive. The goal is compounding: preserving context and provenance so an idea can be revisited, challenged, and extended years later.

Conceptually it descends from the [Memex](./memex). Practically, it shows up as projects like [Project Aldehyde](./project-aldehyde) and systems like [Extracranial](./extracranial) that reduce the cost of linking, retrieval, and maintenance.
