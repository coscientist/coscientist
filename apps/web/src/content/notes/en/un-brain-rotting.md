description:
  Active process of restoring verification and agency in a post-AI information
  environment
---

Un-brain-rotting is the active process of restoring verification capacity and
cognitive agency after exposure to degraded information environments. It is the
opposite of drift: instead of passively absorbing [AI slop](./ai-slop) and
treating fluency as truth, the user deliberately rebuilds the habits of
scrutiny, sourcing, and rebuttal.

The term acknowledges that damage has already occurred. Constant exposure to
plausible but unverified content trains passive acceptance. Un-brain-rotting is
a recovery protocol: re-engaging [active recall](./active-recall), demanding
[traceability](./traceability), and treating [verification](./verification) as a
skill to be practiced.

[Coscientist](./coscientist) is designed to support un-brain-rotting by making
counterevidence visible, preserving the
[responsibility line](./responsibility-line), and keeping the
[Operator](./operator) in the role of verifier rather than consumer.
