title: Minimum Contradiction Set
description: The smallest set of premises and relations that produce a conflict
---

The minimum contradiction set is the smallest collection of premises, claims, and relations that jointly generate a conflict. It is the "core knot" of disagreement: if you can resolve or re-scope this set, the broader conflict often dissolves.

This is why it is the target for human attention in [Exploration Strategies](./exploration-strategies). Techniques like [minimum cut](./minimum-cut) can help surface candidate cores so you do not have to read everything to find what truly matters.
