description: A validation protocol that seeks counter-evidence before acceptance
---

Rebuttal-first search is a validation protocol that looks for counterevidence before accepting a claim. Instead of asking "what supports this?", it asks "what would make this false?", then forces the claim to survive contact with counterexamples, boundary conditions, and alternative explanations.

It acts as a brake against confirmation bias and a defense against link-mediated authority in [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown). In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), it naturally corresponds to generating attacking and undercutting relations early, which later makes synthesis cheaper.
