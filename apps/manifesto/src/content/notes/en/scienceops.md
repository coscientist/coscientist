title: ScienceOps
description: Applying software operations principles to accelerate science
---

ScienceOps is [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s vision for applying software
operations thinking to scientific research: reproducible experiments,
automation, fast iteration, and rigorous provenance. The goal is to collapse the
loop between hypothesis and verification by treating experiments as versioned
artifacts, closer to code than one-off lab notebooks.

This framing motivates roles like the
[natural science engineer](./natural-science-engineer) and creates institutional
demand for a cognitive system like [Coscientist](./coscientist), which can
manage claims, evidence, and rebuttals across many projects.
