title: Dark Night of the Soul
description: A literary device for profound inner crisis leading to identity reconstruction
---

"The Dark Night of the Soul" names a profound inner crisis in which identity,
faith, and one's self-model collapse. From the outside it can look like
breakdown; from the inside it is often a dismantling and reconstruction around
new standards.

The phrase originates in a 16th-century religious context, but modern usage
points more broadly to existential collapse and rebuild. A common pattern is
that old rewards stop working; attachments and self-deception become visible;
and recovery is not a return to the previous state but a reorganization under a
different center of value.

In this Manifesto, the dark night is also a metaphor for civilizational or
epistemic collapse. [Isaac Asimov](./isaac-asimov)'s fall of the
[Galactic Empire](./galactic-empire) is a civilizational dark night, and
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) is a knowledge-system analogue:
when verification collapses, the system needs rebuilding, not more text. A
[knowledge ark](./knowledge-ark) such as the fictional
[Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) is one way to traverse the
night; [Coscientist](./coscientist) aims to do so without surrendering
sovereignty.
