title: Definition Drift
description: "When a term's meaning shifts across time or contexts"
---

Definition drift is the gradual shift in meaning of a term across time, schools,
or fields (see also [Semantic Drift](./semantic-drift) and broader [Drift Phenomena](./drift-phenomena)). It creates false agreement and false contradiction when the same word
is used for different concepts, causing people to appear to argue about
conclusions when they are actually talking past one another.

In [Coscientist](./coscientist), drift is tracked explicitly by separating
definition objects from claims. When a term changes meaning, old claims can be
marked obsolete due to [meaning loss](./meaning-loss) or re-scoped instead of
being silently mixed into a single "consensus."
