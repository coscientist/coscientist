title: Low-Background Steel
description: Steel manufactured before nuclear testing, free of atmospheric radioactive contamination
---

Low-background steel is steel produced before July 16, 1945—the date of the
Trinity nuclear test. Also called pre-war steel or pre-atomic steel, it lacks
the radioactive isotopes that contaminated
all steel manufactured since, because the Bessemer process uses atmospheric air
and nuclear testing released fallout into that air worldwide.

The primary source of low-background steel is sunken warships, particularly the
German High Seas Fleet scuttled at [Scapa Flow](./scapa-flow) in 1919. Protected
underwater from atmospheric contamination, these wrecks became valuable decades
later for applications requiring minimal background radiation: particle physics
detectors, Geiger counters, whole-body medical scanners, and gamma-ray
spectrometers.

Low-background steel is a [pre-contamination resource](./pre-contamination-resource):
a material whose value derives entirely from having been created before a
technological event that permanently altered all subsequently produced
equivalents. No amount of effort can manufacture new pre-1945 steel; the supply
is finite and shrinking as salvage continues.

The parallel to [pre-LLM text](./pre-llm-text) is striking: both are resources
made irreplaceable by a contamination event (nuclear fallout, AI-generated
content), both are essential for the next generation of the very technologies
that made them scarce, and both face supply pressures that will only intensify.
