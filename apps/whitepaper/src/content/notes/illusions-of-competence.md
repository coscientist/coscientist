title: Illusions of Competence
description: A false sense of mastery created by passive familiarity
---

Illusions of competence occur when familiarity is mistaken for mastery. Re-reading, highlighting, and nodding along can feel productive because the material looks "known," but that feeling often disappears when you try to produce the answer unaided.

[Retrieval Practice](./retrieval-practice) and [Active Recall](./active-recall) puncture the illusion by making recall failures explicit, and [Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) keeps that test honest over time.
