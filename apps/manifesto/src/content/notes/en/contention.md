title: Contention
description: A structured conflict between claims that requires resolution
---

Contention is a structured conflict between claims, definitions, or methods. It
is an explicit object representing "these cannot all be true at once" under
shared conditions. Treating contention as first-class matters because it turns
disagreement into something you can map: what conflicts with what, why, and
under which assumptions.

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), contention supports synthesis
that conditions claims rather than averaging them. This is a key limitation of
standard [RAG](./rag), which tends to blur conflicts because it lacks explicit
argumentative relations.
