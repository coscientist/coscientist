Sunghyun Cho is the builder of [Coscientist](./coscientist) and the author of
essays that shaped its direction. His work connects personal knowledge tooling
and [Extracranial](./extracranial) with a broader concern: how to keep
verification and agency intact in an AI-saturated environment.

Cho operates bilingually in his [digital brain](./digital-brain), a practice
that informs his vision of [across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums):
knowledge systems that transcend language boundaries. This multilingual dream
manifested in [Project PIRI](./project-piri) and persists in the design of
[Extracranial](./extracranial) as a [multilingual Memex](./multilingual-memex).
The [Superbrain](./superbrain) concept captures his aspiration for a
[cognitive exoskeleton](./cognitive-exoskeleton) that amplifies human
intelligence across languages.

Entry points include [ScienceOps](./scienceops), [AI Slop](./ai-slop),
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown), and the system overview in
[Coscientist](./coscientist).
