title: Exploration Mechanisms
description: Strategies for continuous knowledge discovery in a dialectical graph
---

Exploration mechanisms are the strategies [Coscientist](./coscientist) uses to
continuously discover contradictions, boundary conditions, and method
dependencies in the [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph).

## Search Strategies

- [Exploration Strategies](./exploration-strategies) — overview of graph
  traversal approaches
- [Counterexample-First Search](./counterexample-first-search) — prioritizing
  breaks over confirmations
- [Rebuttal-First Search](./rebuttal-first-search) — seeking counterevidence
  before acceptance

## Conflict Analysis

- [Minimum Cut](./minimum-cut) — isolating the edges that produce a
  contradiction
- [Minimum Contradiction Set](./minimum-contradiction-set) — finding the core
  premises in conflict

## Method Analysis

- [Method-Conclusion Coupling](./method-conclusion-coupling) — clustering claims
  by method to find shared flaws
- [Replication Path Separation](./replication-path-separation) — distinguishing
  independent paths from restatements

## Semantic Tracking

- [Definition Drift](./definition-drift) — detecting meaning shifts
- [Nonstationarity](./nonstationarity) — recognizing time-driven changes
