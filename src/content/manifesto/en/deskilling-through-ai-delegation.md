title: Deskilling Through AI Delegation
description: Risk of losing learning capacity when AI does the cognitive work
---

Deskilling through AI delegation is the risk that offloading cognitive work to
AI erodes the capacity to do that work unaided. If verification is always
automated, the [Operator](./operator) never practices verification. If synthesis
is always generated, the Operator never learns to synthesize.

This is related to [model collapse](./model-collapse), but it happens in the
human rather than the model: skills atrophy when they are not exercised.
[Meta-learning](./meta-learning) requires doing the learning, not just receiving
the output.

[Coscientist](./coscientist) addresses this by treating AI as a partner for
[contemplation labor](./contemplation-labor) rather than a replacement for
judgment. The Operator still performs [active recall](./active-recall), traces
[evidence spans](./evidence-span), and engages with [contention](./contention).
The system handles search and structuring; the human handles verification and
decision.
