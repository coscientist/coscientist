title: AI Slop
description: Low-quality AI-generated content flooding the internet
---

AI slop is low-effort, high-volume content produced with generative models:
text, images, videos, and even books optimized for throughput rather than
meaning. The term borrows "slop" as a pejorative for output that is cheap to
produce but costly to sift through;
[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) describes it as low-quality
digital content produced in quantity using AI.

In practice, slop includes absurd short-form videos, uncanny advertising
imagery, AI-written books of questionable originality, plausible fake news, and
engagement bait that exploits tragedy or outrage. Once the label exists, it
tends to generalize and to attach to behavior .

The deeper issue is epistemic: slop raises the background noise of the internet,
inflates the cost of verification, and pushes systems toward self-referential
drift. In that sense it is adjacent to both [model collapse](./model-collapse)
and [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) .
