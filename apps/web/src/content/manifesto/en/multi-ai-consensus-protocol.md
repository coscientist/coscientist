title: Multi-AI Consensus Protocol
description: "The 1+4 writing and verification system"
---

The Multi-AI Consensus Protocol is a collaboration workflow in which the
[Operator](./operator) coordinates multiple AI systems to reduce single-model
hallucination risk and help defend against
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown).

In the "1+4" variant, one human coordinates four AI assistants. The point is
not "more memory"; it is structured disagreement and traceability.

## Operating Rules

- Accept revisions only when they reach unanimity.
- Keep uncertainty explicit; do not smooth it away in prose.
- Require traceable provenance for claims and [Provenance](./provenance).
- Run deliberate rebuttal search instead of confirmatory search.

The protocol is also cultural: it trains the habit of asking "what would change
my mind?"

## Limitations

Unanimity is not a proof of truth. Models share training data and can converge
on correlated failure modes, so agreement can reflect shared bias rather than
independent [verification](./verification). Unanimity can also push writing
toward hedging or lowest-common-denominator claims.

In one multi-AI review of the protocol, it received 2 approvals, 1 objection,
and 1 hold, suggesting it needs stronger rebuttal procedures and rules for
evidence independence.
