title: Minimum Cut
description: The smallest set of edges that disconnects a graph
---

A minimum cut is the smallest set of edges whose removal disconnects a graph. In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), minimum-cut analysis can be used to isolate the minimal structure that produces a contradiction between claim clusters.

The cut is not the resolution; it is a focus tool. It highlights which premises and relations must be inspected (often at the level of scope, definition, or method), supporting attention on the [minimum contradiction set](./minimum-contradiction-set).
