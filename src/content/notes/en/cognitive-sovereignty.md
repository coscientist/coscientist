title: Cognitive Sovereignty
description: Human control over judgment and verification in knowledge work
---

Cognitive sovereignty is the commitment to keep human judgment and verification
in control of knowledge production. It rejects passive ratification of AI output
and treats acceptance as a deliberate act backed by sources, counterarguments,
and an explicit chain of responsibility.

In practice, sovereignty means preserving a
[responsibility line](./responsibility-line) for claims and using protocols like
[rebuttal-first search](./rebuttal-first-search) before granting authority. It
is a core responsibility of the [Operator](./operator) and a defense against
[Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown).
