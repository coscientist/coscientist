title: Confidence
description: A multi-dimensional measure of support for a claim
---

Confidence in [Coscientist](./coscientist) is not a single probability score. It is a multi-dimensional status that reflects how a [claim](./claim) has survived scrutiny: what kinds of evidence support it, what challenges it has withstood, and how robust its path structure is.

The dimensions include evidence type (direct observation vs. inference), replication status (independent paths vs. repeated citation), challenge history (has it been attacked and survived?), and path diversity (does support come from multiple independent routes?). A claim can be highly confident on one dimension and weak on another.

This multi-dimensional view prevents the [fluency trap](./fluency-trap): a claim that "feels confident" because it is stated smoothly is not the same as a claim that has been tested and survived. See [Dialectical Graph Nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes) for the status taxonomy.
