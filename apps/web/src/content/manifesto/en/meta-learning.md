Meta-learning is learning about your own learning: noticing what sticks, what
fails, and what conditions change the outcome. It turns "study" from a habit
into a feedback loop with hypotheses, experiments, and adjustments.

Practically, it means tracking which strategies versus re-reading, which
schedules, and which environments actually produce transfer, not just comfort.
