description: Asimov-inspired concepts that inform Coscientist's vision
---

Foundation fiction refers to concepts from [Isaac Asimov](./isaac-asimov)'s
Foundation series that inform [Coscientist](./coscientist)'s vision. The
fictional [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) is a touchstone for
thinking about knowledge preservation and capability.

## Core Concepts

- [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) — the fictional knowledge
  repository
- [Psychohistory](./psychohistory) — Asimov's statistical science of
  civilizations
- [Seldon Plan](./seldon-plan) — [Hari Seldon](./hari-seldon)'s long-range
  strategy
- [Dark Night of the Soul](./dark-night-of-the-soul) — metaphor for
  civilizational or epistemic collapse
- [Knowledge Ark](./knowledge-ark) — repositories designed to survive collapse

## Key Insight

- [From Preservation to Capability](./from-preservation-to-capability) — the
  shift from storing to producing understanding

The fictional encyclopedia is a design target: what would it take to build a
real system that could survive an AI-saturated epistemic environment and still
produce genuine knowledge?
