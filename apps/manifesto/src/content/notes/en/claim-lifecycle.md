title: Claim Lifecycle
description: How claims evolve from tentative hypothesis to robust knowledge or
  obsolescence
---

The claim lifecycle describes how a [claim](./claim) evolves through the
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), from initial entry to eventual status
as robust knowledge, refuted error, or obsolete historical artifact.

## Stages

1. **Entry** — claim extracted from a source and assigned a tentative status
2. **Normalization** — rewritten as a
   [normalized proposition](./normalized-proposition) with explicit
   [scope](./scope) and [assumptions](./assumption)
3. **Challenge** — exposed to [attacks](./attack), [undercuts](./undercut), and
   [counterexamples](./counterexample)
4. **Resolution** — scope narrowed, assumptions clarified, or claim refuted
5. **Stabilization** — reaches conditionally supported, robust, or refuted
   status
6. **Decay** — may become obsolete through
   [definition drift](./definition-drift) or [meaning loss](./meaning-loss)
