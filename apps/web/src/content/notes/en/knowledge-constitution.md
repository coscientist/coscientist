title: Knowledge Constitution
description: "The epistemic protocol layer as a governing document for how claims gain authority"
---

A knowledge constitution is the set of rules that govern how [claims](./claim)
enter a knowledge system, how they are challenged, and what
[traceability](./traceability) is required before they gain authority. It
functions like a political constitution: specifying powers, limits, and
procedures rather than content.

The [epistemic protocol layer](./epistemic-protocol-layer) is
[Coscientist](./coscientist)'s constitution. It commits to sovereignty,
traceability, and adversarial validation. These are constraints on process,
not on conclusions.

A constitution matters because it outlasts any particular claim. Facts change;
the rules for evaluating facts should be stable enough to apply across domains
and time.
