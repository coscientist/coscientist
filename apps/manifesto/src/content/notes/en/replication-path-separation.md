title: Replication Path Separation
description: Asking whether support comes from independent paths or repeated restatements
---

Replication path separation is the practice of asking whether apparent agreement
among sources reflects independent evidence or repeated restatements of the same
underlying claim. Majority agreement is not strong evidence if all agreeing
sources trace back to a single origin.

This is a key defense against [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown),
where AI-generated content can cite itself through intermediaries, creating the
illusion of consensus from circular amplification. Path separation asks: "How
many truly independent paths lead to this conclusion?"

In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), path separation is enabled by
explicit [provenance](./provenance) and `cites` edges. The system can trace
claim support back to original [sources](./source) and detect when apparent
replication is actually repetition.
