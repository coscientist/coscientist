## UI Translation Sync

**Scope**: `apps/web`

### Changes Made

| File | Change |
| ---- | ------ |
| `apps/web/messages/*.json` | Updated all locale strings to match `ko.json` as the source of truth, including landing copy and UI labels. |

### Technical Decisions

1. **Korean as source**: Treated `ko.json` as the canonical copy and translated all other locales from it to keep messaging consistent.

### Verification

- TypeScript: Not run (not requested)
- Build: Not run (not requested)
- Tests: Not run (not requested)

### Next Steps

None.
