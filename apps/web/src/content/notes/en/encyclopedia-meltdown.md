Encyclopedia Meltdown is a knowledge-collapse failure mode that begins when the
initiative and control of writing shift to AI without the
[Operator](./operator)'s conscious intervention. The term comes from an essay by
[Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho).

Meltdown typically emerges from three coupled loops:

1. **Generation → citation**: model outputs get ingested back into the corpus
   and later cited as if they were external facts.
2. **Linkage → authority**: internal links stop functioning as verification
   pathways and become trust badges, so link density substitutes for accuracy.
3. **Responsibility → no-agent**: when it is unclear who asserted what on what
   grounds, correction becomes expensive, and the system stabilizes around an
   "approximately maintained" false steady state.

The result is not just "more errors." Writing loses meaning because there is no
longer a reliable responsibility line; hallucinations can self-reinforce;
contradictions proliferate; and links repackage contamination as authority. Once
the attitude "it must be right because the encyclopedia linked it" takes hold,
human contemplation degenerates from verification into mere ratification.

Prevention starts with a first principle: sovereignty over knowledge must remain
with the [Operator](./operator). In [Coscientist](./coscientist), that shows up
as an [epistemic protocol layer](./epistemic-protocol-layer) and preserving the
[responsibility line](./responsibility-line), a
[Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol), and a
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) that separates inference from
narrative.
