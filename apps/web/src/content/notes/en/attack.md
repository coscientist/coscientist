description: "A direct challenge to a claim's truth"
---

An attack is a direct challenge to the truth of a [claim](./claim). Unlike an
[undercut](./undercut), which targets the grounds, an attack says the claim
itself is false or misleading, typically by providing a
[counterexample](./counterexample) or contradictory evidence.

Attacks are a core edge type in the [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph).
When an attack is registered, the claim's status can shift from `supported` to
`contested` or `refuted` depending on the strength and type of the challenge.

Not all attacks are equal. A well-sourced counterexample carries more weight
than a bare assertion of disagreement. This is why [Coscientist](./coscientist)
tracks [evidence spans](./evidence-span) and [provenance](./provenance) for
attacks as well as for claims.
