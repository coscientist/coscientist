description: Sunghyun Cho's personal digital brain and publishing system
---

Extracranial is [Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s personal digital brain: a
static-site publishing system with automated links and controlled decay. Old
notes fade unless explicitly kept evergreen. It is described as an "Exosuit for
[Superbrains](./superbrain)."

The system implements [multilingual Memex](./multilingual-memex) principles:
automatic language detection, hreflang tags for locale-specific content, and
bilingual operation in English and Korean. This supports
[Sunghyun Cho](./sunghyun-cho)'s vision of going
[across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums), where knowledge is not
constrained by any single language sphere. The architecture allows content to be
written in one language and automatically distributed globally in different
languages.

It grew out of [Project Aldehyde](./project-aldehyde) and the ideas in
[Creating Next-gen Digital Brains](./creating-next-gen-digital-brains).
