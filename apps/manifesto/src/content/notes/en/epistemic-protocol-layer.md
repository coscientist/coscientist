title: Epistemic Protocol Layer
description: Rules and workflows that harden knowledge systems against collapse
---

An epistemic protocol layer is a set of rules, checks, and workflows that harden a knowledge system against error cascades. It functions like a constitution: it specifies how claims enter, how they are challenged, and what traceability is required before they gain authority.

In practice, it includes sovereignty (final judgment stays with the human [Operator](./operator)), traceability (preserving the [responsibility line](./responsibility-line)), and default adversarial validation (for example [rebuttal-first search](./rebuttal-first-search)). The goal is not to slow thinking, but to keep correction cheaper than drift, especially under the pressure of [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown).
