title: Knowledge Constitution
description: The epistemic protocol layer as a governing document for how claims gain authority
---

A knowledge constitution is the set of rules that govern how [claims](./claim) enter a knowledge system, how they are challenged, and what [traceability](./traceability) is required before they gain authority. It functions like a political constitution: specifying powers, limits, and procedures rather than content.

The [epistemic protocol layer](./epistemic-protocol-layer) is [Coscientist](./coscientist)'s constitution. It commits to sovereignty (final judgment stays with the [Operator](./operator)), traceability (preserving the [responsibility line](./responsibility-line)), and adversarial validation (like [rebuttal-first search](./rebuttal-first-search)). These are constraints on process, not on conclusions.

A constitution matters because it outlasts any particular claim. Facts change; the rules for evaluating facts should be stable enough to apply across domains and time.
