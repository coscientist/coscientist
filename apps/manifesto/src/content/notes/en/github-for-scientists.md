description: Vision of treating experiments as versioned, auditable code
---

"GitHub for Scientists" is a vision in which scientific experiments are treated
like code: versioned, repeatable, and auditable. Just as software engineering
moved from ad-hoc scripts to continuous integration and version control, science
could move from one-off lab notebooks to reproducible pipelines with provenance
tracking.

This vision is central to [ScienceOps](./scienceops). When experiments become
versioned artifacts, the loop between hypothesis and
[verification](./verification) shrinks. Failures become traceable. Successes
become replicable by others without heroic effort.

[Coscientist](./coscientist) is the cognitive layer for such a workflow:
managing [claims](./claim), [evidence](./evidence-span), and rebuttals across
many projects while preserving the [responsibility line](./responsibility-line)
and supporting the [natural science engineer](./natural-science-engineer) role.
