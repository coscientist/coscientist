title: Natural Science Engineer
description: A role that applies software-style operations to science
---

A natural science engineer is a practitioner who combines scientific research
with software engineering to make experimentation more reproducible and
scalable. They build tooling, pipelines, automation, and data/versioning
practices that let a lab iterate quickly without losing traceability.

The role is central to [ScienceOps](./scienceops), because operations work
matters as much as clever hypotheses once experiments become complex.
