title: Interleaving
description: Mixing topics or problem types during practice to improve transfer
---

Interleaving is practicing by mixing problem types or topics within the same
session instead of blocking them into separate chunks. The benefit is not magic;
it forces you to notice which method applies when, which improves discrimination
and transfer, especially when concepts are easily confused.

It complements [Retrieval Practice](./retrieval-practice) and
[Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition): you can space sessions over time and
still interleave within a session.
