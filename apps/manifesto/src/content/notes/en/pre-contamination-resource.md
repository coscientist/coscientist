title: Pre-Contamination Resource
description: Materials made irreplaceable by a technological event that altered all subsequent production
---

A pre-contamination resource is a material or artifact whose value derives from
having been created before a technological event that permanently contaminated
all subsequently produced equivalents. The defining characteristic is
irreversibility: no process can create new instances of the resource, because
the contamination event changed the baseline conditions of production itself.

[Low-background steel](./low-background-steel) is the canonical example. Steel
made before July 1945 lacks radioactive isotopes present in all post-nuclear
steel, because the Bessemer process draws from atmospheric air and nuclear
testing contaminated that air globally. The steel from [Scapa Flow](./scapa-flow)
is valuable not because of its metallurgical properties but because of when it
was made.

[Pre-LLM text](./pre-llm-text) follows the same pattern. Human-written content
produced before large language models proliferated is
uncontaminated by AI-generated text. This matters for training future AI systems:
[model collapse](./model-collapse) occurs when models train on their own outputs,
and [training data contamination](./training-data-contamination) makes it
increasingly difficult to verify that web-scraped text is human-authored.

Both resources share a structural irony: they are essential for advancing the
very technologies that made them scarce. Physics experiments need low-background
steel to detect particles; AI systems need pre-LLM text to avoid recursive
degradation. In both cases, the contamination event created demand for the
uncontaminated past.

The existence of pre-contamination resources suggests a general principle:
transformative technologies can inadvertently destroy the inputs required for
their own improvement.
