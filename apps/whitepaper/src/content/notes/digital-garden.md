A digital garden is a public, evolving collection of interlinked notes that grow over time, distinct from finished articles or static blogs. The garden metaphor implies iteration: you publish partial thoughts, revisit them, prune, and let connections emerge instead of treating writing as a one-shot product.

It overlaps with [second brain](./second-brain) practices, but the emphasis is outward: a garden is meant to be read, not merely stored.
