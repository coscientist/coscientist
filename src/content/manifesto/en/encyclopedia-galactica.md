description: A concept for preserving knowledge across dark ages
---

The Encyclopedia Galactica is a fictional device in
[Isaac Asimov](./isaac-asimov)'s [Foundation Fiction](./foundation-fiction) series: a vast repository intended
to preserve human knowledge ahead of civilizational collapse. It is the
[knowledge ark](./knowledge-ark) trope rendered as an institution.

In the story, [Hari Seldon](./hari-seldon)'s [psychohistory](./psychohistory)
predicts the collapse of the [Galactic Empire](./galactic-empire) is unavoidable
and that a long [dark night of the soul](./dark-night-of-the-soul) will follow.
The [Seldon Plan](./seldon-plan) is his attempt to shorten that dark age by
shaping post-collapse trajectories. The encyclopedia project, compiled on
Terminus, functions as both an explicit preservation effort and a strategic seed
for reconstruction.

For [Coscientist](./coscientist), the inspiration is the move from storage to
capability: preservation matters, but an encyclopedia that cannot keep
provenance, surface contradictions, and update by rebuttal will eventually melt
down. The fictional encyclopedia becomes a design target for a real tool that
can survive an AI-saturated epistemic environment, shifting [From Preservation to Capability](./from-preservation-to-capability).

An encyclopedia worthy of the galaxy would necessarily integrate knowledge
[across the Sprachraums](./across-the-sprachraums): across cultures, tongues,
and traditions. This multilingual dimension is why [Coscientist](./coscientist)
is designed for [cross-linguistic synthesis](./cross-linguistic-synthesis),
operating as a [multilingual knowledge mesh](./multilingual-knowledge-mesh)
rather than an English-only system.
