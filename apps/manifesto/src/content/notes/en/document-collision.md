title: Document Collision
description: Protocol of forcing disparate sources to engage with each other's claims
---

Document collision is the protocol of forcing disparate sources to engage with
each other's [claims](./claim) rather than merely summarizing them in parallel.
When documents collide, contradictions become visible, definitions must be
aligned, and [contention](./contention) is surfaced as an explicit object.

This is the opposite of the "balanced summary" approach, which smooths over
disagreement. Collision says: "These two sources say incompatible things. What
specifically conflicts? Under what conditions? What would resolve it?"

In [Coscientist](./coscientist), document collision is implemented through the
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph): claims are extracted, normalized, and
linked by [attack](./attack), [undercut](./undercut), and support relations. The
result is a map of where sources agree, where they conflict, and what remains
open.
