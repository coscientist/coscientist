title: Traceability
description: The ability to follow a claim back to its sources and grounds
---

Traceability is the ability to walk a claim backward through its supporting
structure: from conclusion to premises, from premises to evidence, from evidence
to sources, and from sources to the methods and contexts that produced them. It
is [provenance](./provenance) made actionable.

When traceability breaks, errors become expensive to correct. You may know
something is wrong without knowing why, and fixing it requires re-deriving
rather than adjusting. This is why traceability is a core commitment of the
[epistemic protocol layer](./epistemic-protocol-layer) and why the
[Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) stores explicit relations instead of
leaving attribution implied by prose.

Traceability also enables [knowledge synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis): you can
only align incompatible sources if you can see the path each one took to its
conclusion.
